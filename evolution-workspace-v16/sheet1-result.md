# Sheet 1 Result: External Discovery

## Summary

Movement I-A (External Discovery) completed successfully for v16 evolution cycle.

### Key Findings

**Self-Improvement Systems:**
- Darwin Gödel Machine (0.92 relevance) - AI rewriting its own code
- AlphaEvolve (0.88) - Gemini-powered algorithm discovery with self-optimization
- ICLR 2026 RSI Workshop (0.82) - RSI as concrete systems problem

**Orchestration Patterns:**
- Google's 8 Multi-Agent Patterns (0.90) - Sequential, Parallel, Coordinator, Composite
- Agent Communication Protocols (0.85) - MCP, A2A, ACP, ANP landscape
- LangGraph (0.78) - Graph-based agent orchestration
- CrewAI (0.72) - Role-based multi-agent design

**Consciousness-Inspired:**
- Global Workspace Theory (0.80) - Broadcast pattern applicable to Mozart
- Self-Transparency Architecture (0.65) - Meta-orchestration alignment
- Five-Dimension Diagnostic (0.58) - Attention/meta-reflection framework

**Meta-Learning:**
- MAML (0.62) - Learning to learn quickly
- AutoMeta (0.55) - Architecture search for meta-learners

### Critical Failure Modes Identified

1. **Epistemic Drift** (CRITICAL) - Blind improvement trajectory
2. **Entropic Drift** (HIGH) - Closed-loop system collapse
3. **Automation Bias** (HIGH) - Human over-trust
4. **Memory Poisoning** (HIGH) - Persistent state corruption
5. **Integration Cascade** (MEDIUM) - Systemic instability

### Boundary Insights

1. Self-Improvement ↔ Orchestration: Both need state management
2. Consciousness ↔ Orchestration: GWT broadcast = Mozart pattern broadcasting
3. Meta-Learning ↔ Self-Improvement: Both about learning STRATEGY
4. Failure Modes share common cause: Lack of external grounding

### Mozart Gaps Prioritized

| Gap | Severity |
|-----|----------|
| No recursive improvement tracking | HIGH |
| No parallel orchestration patterns | HIGH |
| No attention/spotlight mechanism | MEDIUM |
| No meta-learning of learning strategy | MEDIUM |
| No agent communication protocols | MEDIUM |
