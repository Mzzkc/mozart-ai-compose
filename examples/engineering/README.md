# Engineering Examples

These scores automate software development workflows — from solving GitHub issues to improving code quality to generating implementation plans from design documents. They demonstrate how AI orchestration can replace manual development cycles with autonomous, multi-stage pipelines that investigate, plan, execute, review, and ship production-ready changes.

### issue-triage.yaml + issue-solver.yaml (concert)

Two scores composed into a concert that autonomously solves any project's GitHub issues.

**issue-triage** runs first (once per project). It profiles the project (language, frameworks, build/test/lint commands, entry points) via **Source Triangulation**, generates a verified test/lint/typecheck/smoke harness with a **Shipyard Gate** (the smoke test must pass before expensive downstream work runs), fetches open issues from the target repository, and passes every issue body through a **Triage Gate**: the Cisco AI skill scanner rejects prompt-injection payloads while a hardened Python pass sanitizes titles/labels of shell-dangerous characters. Surviving issues are classified by effort tier (integer, 1 = no deps), their dependencies extracted and triangulated against GitHub cross-references, and emitted as `issue-dag.yaml` + `issues/sanitized-corpus.yaml` + `project-harness/*.sh` + `project-profile.yaml` — the exact artifacts issue-solver consumes.

**issue-solver** then consumes those artifacts. Each iteration picks the next solvable issue (no unresolved deps, lowest tier, lowest number), investigates the codebase, plans a 1-4 phase implementation strategy, executes each phase with fix+completion passes, runs three parallel quality reviewers (functional, E2E, code quality) whose findings are synthesized before shipping, updates documentation, verifies all tests pass against the generated harness, commits, pushes, closes the GitHub issue, atomically appends to the DAG's resolved list, and **self-chains** to solve the next one.

### quality-triage.yaml (complements issue-triage)

An alternative triage score for cases where you want **multi-perspective review of the local codebase** alongside GitHub issue discovery, not just external issues. Two optional input branches converge on a unified findings set:

- **Local branch**: 4 reviewers with cross-section lens triples — Field Engineer (EXP+SCI+COMP, "debug at 3am"), Architect (SCI+META+CULT, "does this fit?"), New Contributor (COMP+CULT+EXP, "day 3 hire"), Systems Steward (META+CULT+SCI, "three years out") — each runnable on a different instrument family for real cognitive diversity (claude-code / goose / gemini-cli). Local Synthesis triangulates across reviewers (2+ flaggers = corroborated), across lenses (3+ dimensions = multi-dimensional deep issue), and explicitly checks for blind spots.
- **External branch**: cisco-ai-skill-scanner gate + 3-investigator Source Triangulation (issues/code/tests), same as issue-triage.

Both branches fan in to **Unified Triage**: dedup across sources, E1/E2/E3 risk-tier classification (E1=safe auto-fix, E2=human review, E3=escalate), and escalation-gate flagging (touching `scores/`, `daemon/`, `learning/`, or `.marianne/spec/` triggers issue-filing with no auto-PR). Outputs both an internal `issue-dag.yaml` and `findings.json` in ultrareview's schema for A/B comparison with opaque cloud services.

**Note:** `quality-triage` and `issue-triage` use different DAG schemas optimized for different downstream use cases. `issue-triage` is the direct upstream for `issue-solver`. `quality-triage`'s findings.json is ultrareview-compatible; its `issue-dag.yaml` is consumed by humans or custom solvers. Pick based on what you want to do with the findings.

### quality-continuous.yaml

A self-chaining quality improvement pipeline that discovers and fixes code issues without language-specific configuration. Stage 1 generates test/typecheck/lint runner scripts by examining the project. Three parallel expert reviews (Architecture, Test Coverage, Code Debt) scan the codebase from different analytical lenses. Their findings are synthesized, categorized, and prioritized into three remediation batches (quick wins, medium effort, significant). Each batch gets a fix pass and a completion pass. The pipeline verifies all changes, commits, resolves merge conflicts, and files GitHub issues for unresolved problems. Then chains to the next iteration.

This is **Immune Cascade** — cheap broad scanning (expert reviews) identifies ALL issues first, triage creates a targeting brief, then expensive deep work (code fixes) begins on prioritized targets. This avoids wasting fix passes on issues that a cheap sweep would deprioritize. The expert reviews use **Fan-out + Synthesis** — independent parallel reviews produce genuine convergence when 2 of 3 reviewers (who can't see each other) flag the same module.

### score-composer.yaml

Transforms design documents into executable implementation scores. Given a design doc, it produces a structured analysis identifying all deliverables and dependencies, decomposes them into ordered implementation tasks with acceptance criteria, generates a Marianne score YAML where each sheet is one implementation step, validates the score syntax, and produces documentation explaining how to run it.

This is **Succession Pipeline** — each stage requires categorically different methods (analytical reading → decomposition → code generation → syntax validation) and each output becomes the next input substrate. The generated score can then be run to execute the implementation automatically.

### codebase-rewrite.yaml

Iterative language or framework migration that applies three composed patterns. Cathedral Construction provides the iterative build loop — multiple iterations of analyze, rewrite, validate, review, with self-chaining carrying state forward. CEGAR Loop provides progressive refinement — coarse analysis identifies all candidates cheaply, triage verifies which are real before expensive rewrite work begins. Commissioning Cascade provides multi-scope validation — unit tests (fast, isolated) run first, integration tests (cross-module) next, quality review (semantic judgment) last. Each iteration self-chains until convergence.

### saas-app-builder.yaml

Generates a complete, working SaaS application with backend API, frontend UI, and database layer — built in parallel by three independent agents coordinated only through an architecture contract. Prefabrication defines shared interface contracts before parallel builds, making integration mechanical when the contract is precise. Shipyard Sequence validates contracts with structural tools before expensive fan-out. Commissioning Cascade validates at contract scope, integration scope, and system scope, with staged fail-fast if earlier scopes fail.

### lovable-generator.yaml

Web application generator producing a complete deployable app from a concept description. Five movements — Architecture, Foundation (3 parallel voices), Features (4 parallel voices), Polish (2 parallel voices), and Verification — progressively build and refine a working React + TypeScript app. Succession Pipeline stages each transform the workspace from requirements to running application. The practical answer to "can Marianne build a product?" — yes, and this score proves it.

## Adapting to Your Project

### issue-triage.yaml + issue-solver.yaml

**Run triage first (once per project):**

1. Set `repo` to the `owner/name` of the GitHub repository
2. Set `project_root` to the absolute path of the project on disk (for discovery)
3. Authenticate GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
4. Run it: `mzt run examples/engineering/issue-triage.yaml`

Output: `examples/workspaces/issue-triage-workspace/issue-dag.yaml` (plus `issues/sanitized-corpus.yaml`, `project-harness/*.sh`, `project-profile.yaml`) — the artifacts issue-solver consumes.

**Then run the solver (self-chains until the DAG is exhausted):**

1. Set `repo` to the same `owner/name` (validated against the DAG)
2. Set `triage_workspace` to the absolute path of the triage workspace (containing `issue-dag.yaml`)
3. Set `project_root` to the same absolute path used in triage
4. Update `on_success.job_path` to the absolute path of `issue-solver.yaml` (enables self-chaining)
5. Run it: `mzt run examples/engineering/issue-solver.yaml`

**Prerequisites:** gh CLI authenticated, `cisco-ai-skill-scanner` installable via pip (auto-installed by triage), issue-triage has been run and produced a DAG.

**Safety rails:** The solver refuses to push to `main`/`master`/`trunk` unless `ALLOW_PUSH_TO_MAIN=1` is exported. Commit titles are written to a file and committed via `-F` — never interpolated into shell. The DAG is updated atomically before the GitHub issue is closed, so crash-during-close is idempotent on replay.

### quality-triage.yaml

1. Authenticate GitHub CLI if you want the external issue branch: `gh auth login` (optional — branch skips cleanly when unavailable)
2. Run it: `mzt run examples/engineering/quality-triage.yaml`

Output: `examples/workspaces/quality-triage-workspace/issue-dag.yaml` + `findings.json` (ultrareview schema) + `unified-findings.yaml` + `handoff-manifest.md`.

The score does **not** chain to `issue-solver.yaml` automatically. `quality-triage`'s DAG schema (`quality-triage-dag-v1`, with node-id `depends_on` and E1/E2/E3 tier strings) intentionally differs from `issue-triage`'s (`issue-triage-dag-v1`, with issue-number `depends_on` and integer tiers). The DAG includes both a schema discriminator and a `tier_int` alias (E1→1, E2→2, E3→3), so downstream tools that validate the discriminator can adapt. To get the autonomous triage → solve pipeline, use `issue-triage.yaml` directly as the upstream for `issue-solver.yaml`.

**Generic by default** — the score discovers venue structure from the target repo itself. No hardcoded paths. Works on any codebase without modification.

**Prerequisites:** Target is a git repo. `gh` CLI authenticated (optional — external branch skipped if absent). `.marianne/spec/intent.yaml` is optional; score falls back to README + manifests.

**Safety rails:** Escalation-flagged findings (touching score definitions, daemon lifecycle, learning-store schema, or spec corpus) are filed as issues for human review with no auto-PR. Issue bodies flagged by cisco-ai-skill-scanner are replaced with metadata-only summaries before entering any downstream LLM context. Filing is capped at 50 issues per run.

### quality-continuous.yaml

1. Set `workspace` to your preferred output directory
2. Customize `github_label` for your project's issue tracking (e.g., "technical-debt", "code-quality")
3. Update `on_success.job_path` to the absolute path of this score (enables self-chaining iterations)
4. Adjust `instrument_config.timeout_seconds` if your test suite takes longer than 40 minutes per sheet

**Prerequisites:** Source code to review, gh CLI authenticated (optional — only needed for GitHub issue filing in stage 14)

The score is language-agnostic — it generates test/typecheck/lint runner scripts by examining your project structure and tooling, then uses those scripts throughout the pipeline. Works with Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, or any project with verifiable quality commands.

### score-composer.yaml

1. Set `doc` to the path of your design document (Markdown, RFC, spec, or prose plan)
2. Set `output_score` to the desired filename for the generated score (without .yaml extension)
3. Set `project_context` to describe your project — language, frameworks, codebase size, source layout, test directory, key conventions
4. Set `granularity` to "fine" for small TDD-strict tasks (2-5 min each) or "coarse" for larger units of work (10-20 min each)
5. Set `target_workspace` to where the generated implementation score should write its output
6. Set `target_instrument` to the instrument the generated score should use (e.g., "claude-code", "anthropic_api")

**Prerequisites:** Design document exists, project root is accessible

**Output:** A validated, runnable Marianne score with one sheet per implementation task, acceptance criteria as validations, and dependencies declared. Review the generated score, customize if needed, then run it: `mzt run <generated-score>.yaml`

## Patterns Demonstrated

These scores demonstrate core Rosetta patterns for production AI orchestration:

- **Succession Pipeline** — Sequential substrate transformations where each stage requires categorically different methods (issue-solver, score-composer)
- **Fan-out + Synthesis** — Parallel independent work streams whose convergence produces genuine signal (issue-solver review phase, quality-continuous expert reviews)
- **Immune Cascade** — Graduated response where cheap broad scanning identifies targets before expensive deep work begins (quality-continuous)
