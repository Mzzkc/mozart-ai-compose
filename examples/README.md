## Beyond Coding

Mozart is a general-purpose cognitive orchestration system. These examples demonstrate Mozart's capabilities in domains beyond software development.

| Example | Domain | Sheets | Key Innovation |
|---------|--------|--------|----------------|
| [systematic-literature-review.yaml](systematic-literature-review.yaml) | Research | 8 | PRISMA-compliant dual-reviewer validation |
| [training-data-curation.yaml](training-data-curation.yaml) | Data | 7 | Inter-annotator agreement metrics |
| [nonfiction-book.yaml](nonfiction-book.yaml) | Writing | 8 | Snowflake Method with word count gates |
| [strategic-plan.yaml](strategic-plan.yaml) | Planning | 8 | Multi-framework synthesis (PESTEL, Porter, SWOT) |

---

## Example Categories

### Writing & Authoring

**[nonfiction-book.yaml](nonfiction-book.yaml)** - Author a non-fiction book using the Snowflake Method

- Progressive elaboration from 25-word premise to 50,000+ word manuscript
- Entity bible for cross-chapter consistency tracking
- Word count gates at each phase (premise → synopsis → outline → drafts)
- Readability validation (Flesch-Kincaid targets)
- Consistency review loop: draft → audit → revision → polish

### Research & Analysis

**[systematic-literature-review.yaml](systematic-literature-review.yaml)** - PRISMA-compliant systematic review

- 8 phases aligned with PRISMA 2020 methodology
- Dual-reviewer simulation with inter-rater agreement (kappa ≥0.80)
- PICO framework for research question structuring
- Quality assessment using configurable frameworks (Cochrane RoB, etc.)
- PRISMA flow diagram arithmetic validation

### Data & Knowledge

**[training-data-curation.yaml](training-data-curation.yaml)** - ML training dataset creation

- Pilot-to-production progression (test guidelines before full annotation)
- Dual-annotator pattern with adjudication workflow
- Quantitative IAA metrics (Fleiss' kappa, Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's alpha)
- Class imbalance detection and documentation
- Datasheet for Datasets framework (Gebru et al., 2021)

### Planning & Strategy

**[strategic-plan.yaml](strategic-plan.yaml)** - Multi-framework strategic planning

- Three-framework synthesis: PESTEL → Porter's Five Forces → SWOT
- SWOT synthesizes from prior analyses (not generated de novo)
- SMART goal validation (all 5 criteria enforced)
- Weighted criteria evaluation for strategic options
- Risk register with mitigation traceability

## Quality Principles

All examples follow these anti-slop principles:

### 1. Validation at Every Stage
Each sheet has measurable success criteria. Not just "did it run" but "is it good."

```yaml
validations:
  - type: file_exists
    path: "{{ workspace }}/05-data-extraction.md"
  - type: content_contains
    path: "{{ workspace }}/03-screening-decisions.md"
    pattern: "kappa"  # Ensures agreement metric is calculated
```

### 2. Human-Reviewable Output
Intermediate files for inspection. Every phase produces artifacts you can examine before the next phase runs.

### 3. Clear Quality Gates
Quantitative thresholds where possible:
- Inter-rater agreement: κ ≥ 0.80
- Word count minimums: 4000-6000 words per chapter
- Framework coverage: all 6 PESTEL dimensions addressed

### 4. Evidence-Based Content
Citations and sources where applicable. Explicit requirements for evidence:
- Claims must cite sources
- Judgments must reference data
- Fabrication is explicitly forbidden

### 5. Iterative Refinement
Multi-pass improvement built into workflow:
- Draft → Review → Revision patterns
- Pilot → Full execution progressions
- Consistency audits between phases

---

## Running Examples

```bash
# Validate before running (always!)
mozart validate examples/[example].yaml

# Run the example
mozart run examples/[example].yaml

# Check status
mozart status [job-name] --workspace ./[workspace]

# Resume if interrupted
mozart resume [job-name] --workspace ./[workspace]
```

### Running Long Jobs

For jobs that take hours (literature reviews, book authoring), run detached:

```bash
# Detached execution (survives session changes)
setsid mozart run examples/nonfiction-book.yaml > book-workspace/mozart.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress
mozart status nonfiction-book -w ./book-workspace --watch
```

### Pausing and Modifying Jobs

Jobs can be paused gracefully and resumed with updated configuration:

```bash
# Pause a running job
mozart pause nonfiction-book -w ./book-workspace

# Modify the config and resume in one step
mozart modify nonfiction-book -c examples/nonfiction-book-v2.yaml -r -w ./book-workspace

# Or use the two-step workflow for inspection
mozart pause my-job -w ./workspace
# Inspect state, make config changes...
mozart resume my-job -w ./workspace --reload-config -c updated.yaml
```

**When to use pause/modify:**
- Mid-job configuration tweaks (change model, adjust prompts)
- Resource constraints (pause overnight, resume in morning)
- Error recovery (pause, fix config issue, resume with fixed config)

## Creating Your Own

Use these examples as templates. Key customization points:

### 1. Workspace
Where outputs go. Each job needs its own workspace.

```yaml
workspace: "./my-project-workspace"
```

### 2. Backend Configuration
Working directory, timeout, model selection.

```yaml
backend:
  type: claude_cli
  working_directory: /path/to/source/files  # Where to read from
  timeout_seconds: 3600  # 60 min for complex tasks
  disable_mcp: true  # Performance optimization
```

### 3. Variables
Domain-specific context. All examples use `prompt.variables` for user customization:

```yaml
prompt:
  variables:
    research_topic: "Your specific topic here"
    target_audience: "Who this is for"
    # ... domain-specific parameters
```

### 4. Validations
Quality criteria for your use case:

```yaml
validations:
  # File must exist
  - type: file_exists
    path: "{{ workspace }}/output.md"

  # File must contain specific content
  - type: content_contains
    path: "{{ workspace }}/output.md"
    pattern: "conclusion"

  # Command must succeed
  - type: command_succeeds
    command: "wc -w {{ workspace }}/output.md | awk '$1 >= 5000'"
```
