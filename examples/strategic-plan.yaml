       **Option Name:** Clear, memorable label

       **Strategic Intent:** What is this option trying to achieve?

       **Description:** 2-3 paragraph explanation of:
       - What the organization would do differently
       - Key initiatives and investments required
       - Timeline for implementation

       **Rationale:** Why might this work?
       - Which strengths does it leverage?
       - Which opportunities does it capture?
       - How does it address weaknesses or threats?
       - What competitive advantage does it create?

       **Key Assumptions:** What must be true for this to succeed?

       **Major Risks:** What could go wrong?

       **Success Indicators:** How would we know if this is working?

    3. **Option Distinctiveness Check**
       Ensure options are genuinely different:
       - Each option should have a unique strategic logic
       - Options should not be subsets of each other
       - Options should represent different risk/reward profiles
       - At least one option should be "bold" (higher risk, higher reward)
       - At least one option should be "conservative" (lower risk, more incremental)

    ### Output Requirements:

    Create: `{{ workspace }}/05-strategic-options.md`

       - Scoring scale (1-5 with descriptors)
       - Evidence required for each score level

    2. **Systematic Scoring**
       For each strategic option, score against each criterion:

       | Option | [Criterion 1] | [Criterion 2] | ... | Weighted Total |

       For each score:
       - Score (1-5)
       - Evidence/rationale for score
       - Confidence level (high/medium/low)

    3. **Sensitivity Analysis**
       Test robustness of the evaluation:
       - What if criterion weights change?
       - What if key assumptions prove wrong?
       - Which option "wins" under different scenarios?

    4. **Trade-off Analysis**
       Analyze key trade-offs between top options:
       - What do we gain/lose with each choice?
       - Which trade-offs align with organizational values?
       - Which trade-offs are acceptable given risk tolerance: {{ risk_tolerance }}?

    5. **Recommended Strategy**
       - Primary recommendation with full justification
       - Alternative if primary proves infeasible
       - Hybrid possibilities (combining elements of options)
       - What we're deliberately NOT doing and why

    6. **Stakeholder Alignment Check**
       For each stakeholder group:
       - How does the recommended strategy serve their interests?
       - Potential concerns or objections
       - How to address or communicate

    ### Output Requirements:

    - [ ] Sensitivity analysis results
    - [ ] Trade-off analysis
    - [ ] Primary recommendation with justification

    ## Phase 8: Risk Assessment & Contingency Planning

    **Objective:** Identify strategic risks and develop contingency plans to ensure plan resilience.

    ### Prerequisites:
    - All previous documents
    - Goals and roadmap: `{{ workspace }}/07-goals-roadmap.md`

    ### Tasks:

    1. **Strategic Risk Identification**
       Identify risks to plan success:

       Categories:
       - **Execution risks:** Can we actually implement this?
       - **Market risks:** Will the market evolve as expected?
       - **Competitive risks:** How might competitors respond?
       - **Resource risks:** Will we have what we need?
       - **External risks:** What outside factors could derail us?
       - **Assumption risks:** What if key assumptions are wrong?

    2. **Risk Assessment Matrix**
       For each identified risk:
       - **Likelihood:** High (>60%), Medium (30-60%), Low (<30%)
       - **Impact:** High (threatens strategic goals), Medium (requires adjustment), Low (minor deviation)
       - **Velocity:** Fast (immediate impact), Medium (quarters), Slow (years)
       - **Risk score:** Likelihood × Impact
       - **Priority:** Based on score and velocity

    3. **Mitigation Strategies**
       For high-priority risks:
       - Prevention: What can reduce likelihood?
       - Preparation: What can reduce impact?
       - Monitoring: Early warning indicators
       - Ownership: Who is responsible?

    4. **Contingency Plans**
       For top 5 risks:
       - **Trigger:** What indicates the risk is materializing?
       - **Response plan:** What do we do if triggered?
       - **Resources reserved:** What's held in reserve?
       - **Communication plan:** Who needs to know?
       - **Fallback position:** What's our "Plan B"?

    5. **Scenario Planning**
       Develop 3 scenarios:
       - **Optimistic:** Key opportunities materialize, risks don't
       - **Base case:** Most likely trajectory
       - **Pessimistic:** Key risks materialize, opportunities don't

       For each scenario:
       - Key assumptions
       - Implications for the strategic plan
       - Adjustment strategies

    6. **Strategic Plan Summary**
       Executive summary of the complete strategic plan:
       - Strategic context (from Phase 1)
       - Key insights from analysis (Phases 2-4)
       - Selected strategy (Phase 6)
       - Implementation highlights (Phase 7)
       - Risk management approach (this phase)
       - Call to action for stakeholders

    ### Output Requirements:

    Create: `{{ workspace }}/08-risk-contingency.md`

    Must include:
    - [ ] Risk inventory (minimum 10 risks)
    - [ ] Risk assessment matrix with scores
    - [ ] Mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
    - [ ] Contingency plans for top 5 risks
    - [ ] 3 scenarios with adjustment strategies

    Create: `{{ workspace }}/08-strategic-plan-summary.md`

    Must include:
    - [ ] Executive summary (1-2 pages)
    - [ ] Strategy at a glance (key choices, goals, initiatives)
    - [ ] Critical success factors
    - [ ] Immediate next steps
    - [ ] Stakeholder-specific takeaways

    Create: `{{ workspace }}/08-implementation-checklist.md`

    Must include:
    - [ ] Pre-launch checklist
    - [ ] 30-day, 60-day, 90-day priorities
    - [ ] Key decisions needed
    - [ ] Resource mobilization steps
    - [ ] Communication plan outline

    ### Quality Gate:
    Risk assessment must link to plan assumptions. Contingencies must be actionable. Summary must be stakeholder-ready.

    ANTI-SLOP REQUIREMENTS
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    This is strategic planning. Quality standards prevent generic consultant-speak:

    1. **Evidence-Based:** Every strategic claim must cite evidence from analysis phases. No unsupported assertions about "industry trends" or "market opportunities."
    2. **Specific to Context:** The plan must reflect {{ organization_name }}'s unique situation. Generic strategy frameworks filled with platitudes are unacceptable.
    3. **Internally Consistent:** Options, evaluations, and recommendations must trace back to analyses. No contradictions between phases.
    4. **Actionable:** Every recommendation must specify who does what by when. Vague "we should" statements are insufficient.
    5. **Honest About Uncertainty:** If data is limited or assumptions are shaky, say so explicitly. False confidence is worse than acknowledged uncertainty.

    Do NOT:
    - Use generic strategic buzzwords without specific meaning
    - Make claims about markets or competitors without evidence
    - Skip difficult trade-offs or pretend there are easy answers
    - Generate options that are obviously impractical
    - Create goals that cannot be measured

  stakes: |
    This strategic plan may guide real organizational decisions and resource allocation.
    Stakeholders will invest time, money, and careers based on this direction.
    Sloppy analysis leads to strategic missteps. Every phase must be rigorous.
