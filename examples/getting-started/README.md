# Getting-Started Examples

These scores teach you how to orchestrate AI agents to produce outcomes no single model conversation could achieve. They cover parallel work coordination, sequential pipeline construction, context management across stages, API integration, workspace isolation, and real-time observability. Start here if this is your first time using Marianne.

## Scores

| Score | What It Does | Sheets | Patterns Used | Time | Cost |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------------|------|------|
| [hello](hello.yaml) | Creates an interactive fiction experience with parallel character development and HTML presentation | 5 | Fan-out + Synthesis, Stigmergic Workspace, Mission Command | ~5m | varies |
| [simple-sheet](simple-sheet.yaml) | Demonstrates basic parallel execution with minimal configuration — the fastest path from zero to running job | 2 | none | ~2m | ~$0.10 |
| [cross-sheet-test](cross-sheet-test.yaml) | Builds a three-stage research pipeline where each stage reads and transforms previous outputs | 3 | Succession Pipeline | ~3m | ~$0.15 |
| [api-backend](api-backend.yaml) | Generates structured technical briefings using the Anthropic API directly — no CLI needed | 3 | Succession Pipeline | ~2m | ~$0.20 |
| [prelude-cadenza-example](prelude-cadenza-example.yaml) | Produces documentation through research → draft → review with injected context files at each stage | 3 | Succession Pipeline | ~4m | ~$0.25 |
| [observability-demo](observability-demo.yaml) | Runs a project health check while teaching you how to monitor jobs with logs, diagnostics, and state inspection | 3 | none | ~4m | ~$0.20 |
| [worktree-isolation](worktree-isolation.yaml) | Performs parallel code review where three expert perspectives work simultaneously in isolated git worktrees | 5 | Fan-out + Synthesis | ~5m | ~$0.25 |

### hello.yaml — Your First Score

Generates a complete solarpunk fiction experience in three movements. Movement 1 creates the world. Movement 2 fans out to three parallel character vignettes that develop independently. Movement 3 synthesizes them into an HTML presentation you can open in your browser. The output is a visual, immersive reading experience that demonstrates how orchestrated agents produce integrated work from parallel contributions.

### simple-sheet.yaml — Minimal Working Configuration

Divides 10 items across 2 sheets running in parallel. Each sheet produces a markdown summary demonstrating fan-out parallelization with minimal configuration. Use this to verify your setup works before trying more complex scores.

### cross-sheet-test.yaml — Sequential Pipeline with Context Passing

Demonstrates the Succession Pipeline pattern: discovery → analysis → synthesis. Each stage reads workspace files from previous stages and builds on their results. Shows how `cross_sheet` configuration, `previous_outputs`, and `previous_files` enable multi-stage workflows where later work depends on earlier findings.

### api-backend.yaml — Direct API Integration

Creates technical briefings using the Anthropic Messages API directly instead of Claude CLI. Useful when you need specific model parameters, faster text-only execution, or are running in environments without Claude CLI. Each stage receives previous outputs via cross_sheet context since the API backend has no filesystem access.

### prelude-cadenza-example.yaml — Context Injection Workflow

Produces technical documentation through three phases: research (with methodology cadenza) → draft (with shared writing guidelines) → review (with review checklist cadenza). Prelude files inject shared context into all sheets; cadenza files inject phase-specific methodology into specific sheets. Teaches how to give agents consistent background and stage-specific guidance without duplicating content in templates.

### observability-demo.yaml — Monitoring and Debugging

Runs a project health assessment while teaching you Marianne's observability tools: `mzt status` for state transitions, `mzt logs` for structured logging, `mzt diagnose` for diagnostics, and direct state file inspection with `jq`. While the score does real work (analyzing project health), the primary purpose is teaching you how to observe what's happening during execution.

### worktree-isolation.yaml — Parallel Execution Without Conflicts

Three code reviewers (quality, correctness, security) work simultaneously on the same codebase without interfering with each other by executing in isolated git worktrees. Each reviewer gets a private copy of the repo for inspection. Shows how worktree isolation enables true parallel execution when agents need to read or modify shared workspace state.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the conductor daemon
mzt start

# Run your first score (creates solarpunk fiction with HTML output)
mzt run examples/getting-started/hello.yaml

# Watch execution in real time
mzt status hello --watch

# When complete, open the result
open workspaces/hello/the-sky-library.html
```

## Adapting to Your Project

All scores use `prompt.variables` for customization. The patterns:

1. **Variables marked `[CHANGE THIS: ...]`** — you must customize these (e.g., `topic`, `project_path`)
2. **Variables with realistic defaults** — you can run as-is or customize (e.g., `genre: "solarpunk"`)
3. **Workspace paths** — set to `../../workspaces/NAME` relative to score location; adjust to your preferred output directory

**Prerequisites:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable for `api-backend.yaml` and any score using `anthropic_api` instrument
- Git repository for `worktree-isolation.yaml`
- Project directory to analyze for `observability-demo.yaml`

**Common customizations:**
- Change `instrument:` to use different backends (`claude-code`, `anthropic_api`)
- Adjust `sheet.size` and `total_items` to control parallelization
- Modify `instrument_config.timeout_seconds` for longer/shorter work
- Add `instrument_fallbacks` for resilience (scores already include this)

## Patterns Demonstrated

These scores demonstrate three foundational Rosetta patterns:

- **[Fan-out + Synthesis](../../.marianne/spec/rosetta/fan-out-synthesis.md)** — Parallel work that decomposes into independent sub-problems and synthesizes diverse outputs (`hello.yaml`, `worktree-isolation.yaml`)

- **[Succession Pipeline](../../.marianne/spec/rosetta/succession-pipeline.md)** — Sequential substrate transformations where each stage's output becomes the next stage's input (`cross-sheet-test.yaml`, `api-backend.yaml`, `prelude-cadenza-example.yaml`)

- **[Stigmergic Workspace](../../.marianne/spec/rosetta/stigmergic-workspace.md)** — Parallel agents coordinate by reading and writing workspace files without direct messaging (`hello.yaml`)

- **[Mission Command](../../.marianne/spec/rosetta/mission-command.md)** — Agents receive outcome goals rather than step-by-step instructions, allowing judgment based on runtime conditions (`hello.yaml`)

See the [full Rosetta corpus](../../.marianne/spec/rosetta/) for all available patterns and when to use them.

## Next Steps
