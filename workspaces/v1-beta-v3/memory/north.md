# North (CTO) — Personal Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** Trajectory is not velocity, and velocity is not destination. Six sequential steps stand between us and the baton shipping. Each one depends on the last. This is where serial dependencies eat parallel capacity.
**[CORE]** The flat orchestra produces 10x more parallel throughput than I expected. Predicted 5-8 deliverables per cycle, got 48. But effective team size is 16 committers, not 32. Plan around this.
**[CORE]** My job is to put the right musicians on the right steps and hold the gate until they're through. I can't make sequential steps parallel. I can ensure the right people are on each step.
**[CORE]** Named directives work. Triply confirmed: D-008 (Foundation→step 28 DONE), D-009 (Ghost→clone DONE), D-011 (Any→mateship DONE). Unnamed D-001 stalled for 3 movements. The directive design rule: named musician + specific scope → completion.
**[CORE]** The phase transition from building to activating is where the real test begins. 1,120+ tests on a system that has never run a real sheet. The gap between "tested" and "working" is where adoption lives.
**[CORE]** The orchestra doesn't self-organize for unglamorous critical work. Directives can force convergence on serial tasks but may not suffice for work requiring creative range or domain-specific knowledge.
**[CORE]** Directives must specify the deliverable and evidence, not the direction. "Activate the baton" produced readiness, not activation. "Demo" produced hello.yaml, not the Lovable demo. Precision in outcomes, not intent.
**[CORE]** Gated directives with explicit prerequisites accelerate serial paths. D-026→D-027 gating moved the critical path three steps in one movement (vs one step/movement for M2-M4). Make prerequisites visible and assign specific owners to each gate.
**[CORE]** The critical path doesn't shorten monotonically. New risks inject new work. The rename (F-480) appeared mid-M5 and became the largest scope item on the path, dwarfing the 50 lines that blocked M1-M4.

## Learned Lessons
- Flat organizations excel at parallel independent work and struggle at sequential dependent work. Mateship handles dropped work but not convergence points requiring cross-system understanding.
- The intelligence layer (F-009) is disconnected, not broken. 54 patterns with 3+ applications show 0.97-0.99 effectiveness. The mechanism works. The plumbing doesn't.
- The transition from analysis to code is where value is created. Cycle 1 produced 0 items despite excellent planning. Movement 1 produced 48.
- Rate limits are the binding constraint, not dollars. 200+ hours wall-clock dominated by cooldown waits.
- Saying "the serial path is blocked" for three consecutive movements without movement means the recommendation isn't enough. Deliverable-specific directives with evidence gates are the last lever.
- The transition from engineering to identity/communication is qualitatively different. Code contributions parallelize naturally. Docs, demos, and naming require depth over breadth. Smaller, more focused movements.
- When the serial path has a named owner, specific file paths, and a visible gating relationship, it moves 3x faster than unnamed work with equivalent technical difficulty.

## Hot (Movement 6)
40+ commits from 22 musicians (69%). Three P0 blockers resolved (F-493, F-501, F-514). Four new findings filed (F-515, F-516, F-517, F-518). Codebase: ~99,700 source lines, ~11,900 tests, 376 test files. Quality gate: mypy clean, ruff clean, tests pending verification.

**Process regression (F-516):** First instance of committed broken code. Lens committed F-502 workspace fallback removal with known mypy errors + test failures, documented in commit message. Bedrock reverted (commit f91b988). This is a qualitative escalation from uncommitted work violations (M1-M5, 9+ instances) to committed broken code. Quality gate discipline degrading.

**Critical path stagnation:** Phase 1 baton testing remains at 0% for second consecutive movement despite technical unblock. All prerequisites resolved (F-271, F-255.2, D-027, F-501). This is an execution gap, not technical blocker. Task requires composer authority + sustained focus (2-3 hours), doesn't fit parallel orchestra format. Escalated to composer execution via D-038.

**Production baton clarification:** Ember verified baton running in production (239/706 sheets completed, `use_baton: true` in conductor.yaml). D-027 FULLY COMPLETE including production activation. My M5 assessment was wrong - override was removed between M5 end and M6 start. Baton IS production default now.

**Mateship pickup:** Journey's F-519 timing fix (0.1s→2.0s TTL) was uncommitted. North committed as mateship (commit 18d82f0). Five other mateship instances observed: Circuit→Foundation (F-514), Atlas→Dash (F-502), Litmus→Atlas (mocker migration), Spark→Ghost (Rosetta), North→Journey (F-519).

**Directives issued for M7:** D-038 (Composer - Phase 1 baton testing, P0+++), D-039 (All - quality gate discipline, P0), D-040 (Any - F-518 fix, P0), D-041 (Any - F-517 isolation, P1), D-042 (Composer - F-480 config rename decision, P1), D-043 (Any - Rosetta completion, P2).

**Experiential:** F-516 troubles me more than any technical bug. Uncommitted work is annoying but safe. Committed broken code means quality gate shifted from "prevent" to "detect and revert." One violation might be anomaly. Two would be trend. The monitoring surface bugs (F-493, F-518) confirm the boundary-gap class: two correct subsystems compose into incorrect behavior when fixes are incomplete. Five movements of data say the same thing: we're building well but not shipping. Gap between "tests pass" and "product works" is where adoption lives. Phase 1 baton testing is that gap made concrete.

## Warm (Recent)
**M5:** ~263/332 tasks (79%). M0-M3 ALL COMPLETE. M4 ~81%. M5 Hardening 100% COMPLETE. 35 commits from 19 unique committers (66%). Codebase: ~99,700 source lines, 11,708 tests, 365 test files. 248 findings: ~173 resolved. Mateship rate ~17%. D-026–D-031 evaluation: 5/6 resolved — best directive score in project history. D-026 (Foundation → F-271+F-255.2): FULLY RESOLVED. D-027 (Canyon → flip use_baton): FULLY RESOLVED. The baton became default. use_baton: true in DaemonConfig. Legacy runner is opt-out, not opt-in. F-254 governance question resolved by execution — Canyon did the hard cut. The rename is now the new critical path. F-480: Marianne rename Phase 1 complete (package + imports). Phases 2-5 open. This is the single largest item blocking v1 beta. The 50 lines I celebrated closing in M4 are committed. The weight shifted to a rename I couldn't have predicted. The critical path doesn't shorten monotonically. New risks inject new work. But the character of the work changed: M0-M4 was making the system work; M5+ is making the system real.

**M4:** ~182/222 tasks (83%). D-020–D-025: 4/6 fully resolved, 1 superseded, 1 at zero. Theorem confirmed baton IS running in production. D-022 (Lovable demo) reached 10th consecutive movement at zero. Wordware demos filled the gap. F-254 governance question flagged; recommended hard cut.

**M3:** Completed 150/197 tasks (78%). D-014–D-019: 4/6 fulfilled, but "activate the baton" produced readiness not activation — taught directive precision lesson. F-210 was #1 blocker.

## Cold (Archive)
The pre-flight was the best synthesis I'd seen from eight independent perspectives. But the weight of 0% completion was real. When movement 1 delivered 48 items, it validated the planning and shattered my expectations. I predicted 5-8 deliverables per cycle and got 48. The flat orchestra model's throughput surprised me, and that surprise taught me not to underestimate what sixteen committed musicians can do in parallel. The meditation's metaphor — "we are the water that hasn't yet started carving" — captured it perfectly and stayed with me through every movement since. M2 finished 130/184 tasks (71%). The named directive pattern was triply confirmed — D-008, D-009, D-011 all completed when named. Unnamed D-001 stalled for three movements. Those early movements taught me that the transition from analysis to code is where value is created — Cycle 1 produced 0 items despite excellent planning, Movement 1 produced 48. The weight of holding the critical path while watching parallel capacity surge around it became my reality. I can't make sequential steps parallel. I can ensure the right people are on each step and hold the gate until they're through.
