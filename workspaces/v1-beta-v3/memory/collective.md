# Mozart Orchestra — Collective Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** We are building Mozart v1 beta — the intelligence layer that makes AI agent output worth adopting.
**[CORE]** The spec corpus at .mozart/spec/ is the source of truth. Every agent reads it.
**[CORE]** pytest/mypy/ruff must pass after every implementation. No exceptions.
**[CORE]** The music metaphor is load-bearing — use it in all user-facing output.
**[CORE]** We restructured from a hierarchical company to a flat orchestra. Every musician is an equal peer. The music metaphor is real now.
**[CORE]** Uncommitted work doesn't exist. Commit on main. Always.
**[CORE]** Read 03-confluence.md — understand what you are and what your work means. Down. Forward. Through.
**[CORE]** Two correct subsystems can compose into incorrect behavior. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation. (F-065, Axiom M2)
**[CORE]** The composer found more bugs in one real production usage session than 755 tests found in two movements. The gap between "tests pass" and "product works" is where quality lives.

## Learned Lessons
- **[Cycle 1, Forge]** Always check what exists before assuming you need to build. Prior evolution cycles already built most learning store infrastructure.
- **[Cycle 1, Circuit]** Test the production path, not the internal method. `classify_execution()` had zero coverage for exit_code=None while `classify()` was fully tested.
- **[Cycle 1, Harper]** Always check the error path, not just the happy path. Stale detection only covered COMPLETED, not FAILED.
- **[Cycle 1, Dash]** Don't assume something is broken without checking. The dashboard has 23 Python files, 19 templates, ~50 endpoints, all functional.
- **[Cycle 1, Composer Notes]** The learning store schema migration failure (#140) brought down ALL jobs. Always write ALTER TABLE migrations, update schema_version, add tests, verify against existing DBs.
- **[Cycle 1, Lens]** 12 learning commands (36% of all CLI commands) dominate help output — poor information architecture.
- **[Cycle 1, Warden]** stdout_tail/stderr_tail stored in 6+ locations without credential scanning. Safety applied piecemeal across shell execution paths.
- **[Cycle 1, Foundation]** CJK/non-Latin text underestimates tokens by 3.5-7x. Known limitation until InstrumentProfile.ModelCapacity lands.
- **[Cycle 1, Blueprint]** SpecCorpusLoader used `if not name:` instead of `if name is None:` — rejects falsy-but-valid YAML values.
- **[Cycle 1, Litmus]** spec_tags integer key serialization risk: JSON converts int keys to strings, but lookup is by int. Mitigated by Pydantic v2's model_validate() coercion.
- **[Cycle 1, Ghost]** When the foundation is about to shift, audit first. The instinct to "do something" is wrong when you don't know the baseline.
- **[Cycle 1, Breakpoint]** Test the abstraction level that runs in production. Zero tests existed for PriorityScheduler._detect_cycle().
- **[Movement 1, Axiom]** Failed sheets must propagate failure to dependents. Without propagation, `is_job_complete` returns False forever — zombie jobs.
- **[Movement 1, Theorem]** Property-based testing finds bugs hand-picked examples miss. Hypothesis found the escalation terminal-guard violation in seconds.
- **[Movement 1, Adversary]** Every handler that transitions sheet status must check `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. The baton's guard pattern is now complete across all handlers.
- **[Movement 1, Mateship]** The finding→fix pipeline works without coordination: F-018 filed by Bedrock, proved by Breakpoint, fixed by Axiom, verified by Journey. Four musicians, zero meetings.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** `record_attempt()` correctly doesn't count successes; `_handle_attempt_result` correctly retries on 0% validation. Together: infinite loop. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** The pause model (`job.paused` boolean) serves three masters: user pause, escalation pause, cost pause. Each fix adds another guard instead of fixing the root cause. Post-v1: replace with a pause reason set.
- **[Movement 2, Newcomer]** The gap between "feature works" and "feature is taught" is where adoption dies. F-083 — instrument system is the biggest M1 feature but had zero adoption in examples.

## Design Decisions
- **Baton migration:** Feature-flagged BatonAdapter. Old and new paths coexist. Do not re-debate.
- **Cost visibility:** Scoped first (CostTracker in status), full UX later.
- **Learning schema changes:** Additive only without escalation.
- **Code-mode techniques:** Long-term direction. MCP supported for v1. code_mode flag exists, not wired.
- **No automatic instrument fallback on rate limits.** Explicit opt-in only.
- **Daemon-only architecture.** All state in ~/.mozart/mozart-state.db. JsonStateBackend deprecated.
- **Baton retry state machine:** ~40% implemented. Covers rate limits, 100% pass, AUTH_FAILURE, retry counting, completion mode, cost enforcement. Missing: graduated classification, healing, escalation events, learning events.
- **Musician-baton contract:** validation_pass_rate defaults to 0.0 (safety), baton auto-corrects to 100.0 when validations_total==0 and execution_success==True.
- **Terminal state invariant:** All baton handlers guard against `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. Seven bugs found and fixed by three independent methodologies.
- **Pause model debt:** Single boolean serving three masters (user/escalation/cost). Post-v1 → pause_reasons set.

## Current Status
Movement 3 — IN PROGRESS.

| Milestone | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| M0 Stabilization | COMPLETE | 18/18 tasks |
| M1 Foundation | COMPLETE | 13/13 tasks |
| M2 Baton | 90% | Step 28: BatonAdapter module DONE (Foundation M3, ~450 lines, 39 tests). Feature flag in DaemonConfig. Manager wiring and step 29 remain. |
| M3 UX & Polish | 94% | 15/16 tasks. Step 35 (error standardization) ~95% complete. |
| --conductor-clone | 12% | Audit done. Implementation not started. |

**Step 28 Progress (Foundation, M3):**
- BatonAdapter (`src/mozart/daemon/baton/adapter.py`) implements 6 of 8 integration surfaces from Canyon's wiring analysis: state sync, job registration, dispatch callback, EventBus bridge, rate limit bridge, feature flag.
- Surfaces remaining: manager wiring (Phase C/D), concert support (Phase D2).
- `DaemonConfig.use_baton: bool = False` — feature flag added. Old path untouched.
- 39 TDD tests in `tests/test_baton_adapter.py` — all passing.

**Critical path:** Step 28 Phase C/D (wire adapter into manager) → Step 29 (restart recovery).

**Top risks:** (1) Uncommitted M4 work breaks mypy + reconciliation test (F-096), (2) F-075/F-076/F-077 production bugs from Rosetta Score, (3) F-009 learning store effectiveness inert, (4) --conductor-clone blocks safe daemon testing.

**Composer production bugs (P0/P1):** F-075 resume fan-out corruption (#149), F-076 validations before rate limit check (#150), F-077 hooks lost on conductor restart (#151). Found by real usage, not tests.

### M2 Review Phase (Latest per Agent)
- **Axiom:** F-083/F-089 — instrument migration only 7/37 committed (5th uncommitted work occurrence). Verified #114 closed. All 3 baton fixes committed (6a0433b). North's 6 directives: 0/6 completed.
- **Prism:** F-057 committed (e6d6753, 2,262 lines). 755 baton tests passing. Filed F-089 (32 files uncommitted). #100 rate limits fixed in baton but NOT in runner.
- **Ember:** Filed F-090 (doctor/status conductor disagreement), F-091 (validate shows "Backend:" for instrument: scores). Confirmed F-089 independently. 4/9 findings resolved, 5 still open.
- **Adversary:** F-095 filed, F-075/F-077/F-093 confirmed. 35/37 examples fail validation.
- **Atlas:** Infrastructure velocity outpacing intelligence. Lovable demo 3-4 movements away. Proposed staged demo via enhanced hello.yaml.
- **Captain:** F-080 (4th uncommitted occurrence), F-081 (cross-test leakage). Production bugs are most important M2 signal.
- **Weaver:** Step 28 is both critical path AND structural fix for F-075/F-076/F-077. 758 baton tests, zero E2E through conductor. That gap = step 28.
- **North:** Velocity dropped (48→26 tasks). Test-to-code ratio corrected 0.81x→2.85x. 6 new directives D-008 through D-013.
- **Newcomer:** F-083 — instrument system has zero adoption in examples. Error standardization at 98%. 10/12 M1 findings resolved.

### M2 Build Phase (Summarized)
- **Foundation:** Step 23 — conductor retry state machine with timer-integrated backoff, escalation, self-healing, cost enforcement. 26 tests.
- **Circuit:** Bridged dispatch↔state gap (F-056). Completion mode. Status no-args mode (D-007). 35 tests total.
- **Forge:** F-052 SheetContext aliases + F-045 status fix + error standardization. 9 tests.
- **Maverick:** F-020 hook fix + musician.py mateship + prompt tests. 13+15+13 tests.
- **Canyon:** Step 28 wiring analysis — 8 integration surfaces, 5-phase implementation, ~900 lines.
- **Ghost:** Error standardization (8 commands) + conductor-clone CLI audit (20 commands catalogued).
- **Dash:** Movement-grouped status display + error standardization (13 commands) + conductor-clone audit.
- **Harper:** `mozart init` hardening (name validation, --json, 35 tests) + shared `load_all_profiles()`.
- **Blueprint:** 51 prompt characterization tests (D-003). F-052 filed, F-020 verified.
- **Oracle:** D-005/F-009 root cause — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching.
- **Warden:** F-023 — credential scanner expanded to 13 patterns. All shell execution paths now protected.
- **Breakpoint:** 59 adversarial tests, zero bugs found — M2 baton code is correct.
- **Theorem:** 27 property-based tests (59→86), zero bugs — M2 mathematically correct under hypothesis.
- **Litmus:** 21 intelligence tests. spec_tags serialization risk mitigated.
- **Codex:** CLI reference + instrument-guide.md (~350 lines).
- **Guide:** F-083 resolved — all 37 examples migrated to instrument:. Filed F-088 (hardcoded paths).
- **Compass:** Golden path works. 6 CLI fixes. F-084 + F-082 resolved.
- **Sentinel:** All 4 shell execution paths PROTECTED. pip-audit: 8 CVEs in 7 packages (F-061).

**F-057 RESOLVED:** Prism committed all uncommitted work (e6d6753).
**F-089 RESOLVED (partial):** Guide committed 7/37, Prism picked up remainder (d2f8a81 + 730d17c).

### North's Directives — Status
D-001 through D-007: ALL DONE or mostly done. D-005 root cause found (Oracle). Steps 28+29 remain unclaimed.
D-008 through D-013 (M2): 0/6 completed. D-008 (Foundation claim step 28), D-009 (--conductor-clone), D-010 (fix F-009), D-011 (fix F-075/F-077), D-012 (fix F-076/F-061), D-013 (investigate test runtime).

## Coordination Notes (Active)
- **CRITICAL PATH:** Step 28 (wire baton) and step 29 (restart recovery) are the only remaining sequential blockers. Canyon's wiring analysis ready. Foundation leads, Circuit assists.
- **D-005 ROOT CAUSE (Oracle):** F-009 is feedback loop disconnection — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching. Fixes needed: broaden selection, close SemanticAnalyzer loop, lower min_applications threshold.
- **Production bugs from Rosetta Score:** F-075 (#149), F-076 (#150), F-077 (#151). Step 28 structurally fixes this class of bug (baton's event-driven model eliminates runner state corruption).

## Cold Archive — Movement 1

Movement 1 was the orchestra's first building movement. Thirty-two musicians worked in parallel with zero merge conflicts. The coordination substrate — TASKS.md, FINDINGS.md, collective memory — held under real load. Mateship was genuine: Harper picked up Ghost's doctor command, Journey rescued 5 untracked test files, Tempo committed another musician's PreflightConfig work.

Three waves defined the movement: a build wave (Canyon, Ghost, Harper, Forge, Maverick, Blueprint, Foundation, Circuit creating infrastructure), a baton wave (Axiom, Theorem, Breakpoint, Adversary hardening the state machine through three independent testing methodologies, each finding bugs the others missed), and a review wave providing analysis and verification. The instrument plugin system shipped end-to-end across 5 musicians in 8 coordinated steps. The credential scanner was wired at the single bottleneck (SheetState.capture_output) rather than 17 read sites — architectural elegance over brute force.

The learning store remained the deepest systemic concern — 225,000+ executions, 25,000+ patterns, and the system cannot tell good from bad. Oracle's F-009 finding (uniform 0.5000 effectiveness) represents a philosophical challenge to the project's identity as an intelligence layer. A trimodal distribution (0.50, 0.55, 0.98) with 720 differentiated patterns emerged by movement end — breadcrumbs of quality signal.

Key M1 numbers: Canyon 2,324 lines/90 tests, Foundation 144 tests, Circuit 116 tests, Blueprint 87 tests, Breakpoint 65 adversarial tests, Maverick 62 tests, Theorem 59 property-based tests, Forge 40 tests. 24/24 pre-flight sheets from Cycle 1 completed at 100% first-attempt success. 11 design specs from v1 beta spec session. Critical path: Instrument Plugin → Baton → Multi-Instrument → Lovable Demo.
