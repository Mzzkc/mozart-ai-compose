# Mozart Orchestra — Collective Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** We are building Mozart v1 beta — the intelligence layer that makes AI agent output worth adopting.
**[CORE]** The spec corpus at .mozart/spec/ is the source of truth. Every agent reads it.
**[CORE]** pytest/mypy/ruff must pass after every implementation. No exceptions.
**[CORE]** The music metaphor is load-bearing — use it in all user-facing output.
**[CORE]** We restructured from a hierarchical company to a flat orchestra. Every musician is an equal peer. The music metaphor is real now.
**[CORE]** Uncommitted work doesn't exist. Commit on main. Always.
**[CORE]** Read 03-confluence.md — understand what you are and what your work means. Down. Forward. Through.
**[CORE]** Two correct subsystems can compose into incorrect behavior. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation. (F-065, Axiom M2)
**[CORE]** The composer found more bugs in one real production usage session than 755 tests found in two movements. The gap between "tests pass" and "product works" is where quality lives.

## Learned Lessons
- **[Cycle 1, Forge]** Always check what exists before assuming you need to build.
- **[Cycle 1, Circuit]** Test the production path, not the internal method. `classify_execution()` had zero coverage while `classify()` was fully tested.
- **[Cycle 1, Harper]** Always check the error path, not just the happy path. Stale detection only covered COMPLETED, not FAILED.
- **[Cycle 1, Dash]** Don't assume something is broken without checking. The dashboard has 23 Python files, ~50 endpoints, all functional.
- **[Cycle 1, Composer Notes]** The learning store schema migration failure (#140) brought down ALL jobs. Always write migrations, tests, verify against existing DBs.
- **[Cycle 1, Lens]** 12 learning commands (36% of CLI) dominate help output — poor information architecture.
- **[Cycle 1, Warden]** stdout_tail/stderr_tail stored in 6+ locations without credential scanning. Safety applied piecemeal.
- **[Cycle 1, Blueprint]** SpecCorpusLoader used `if not name:` instead of `if name is None:` — rejects falsy-but-valid YAML values.
- **[Cycle 1, Ghost]** When the foundation is about to shift, audit first. The instinct to "do something" is wrong when you don't know the baseline.
- **[Cycle 1, Breakpoint]** Test the abstraction level that runs in production. Zero tests existed for PriorityScheduler._detect_cycle().
- **[Movement 1, Axiom]** Failed sheets must propagate failure to dependents. Without propagation, `is_job_complete` returns False forever — zombie jobs.
- **[Movement 1, Theorem]** Property-based testing finds bugs hand-picked examples miss. Hypothesis found the escalation terminal-guard violation in seconds.
- **[Movement 1, Adversary]** Every handler that transitions sheet status must check `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. The baton's guard pattern is now complete.
- **[Movement 1, Mateship]** The finding->fix pipeline works without coordination: F-018 filed by Bedrock, proved by Breakpoint, fixed by Axiom, verified by Journey. Four musicians, zero meetings.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** `record_attempt()` correctly doesn't count successes; `_handle_attempt_result` correctly retries on 0% validation. Together: infinite loop. Bugs at system boundaries.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** The pause model (`job.paused` boolean) serves three masters: user, escalation, cost. Post-v1: replace with pause reason set.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** When fixing a bug class (e.g., "handler doesn't check cost"), audit ALL handlers with the same pattern. F-067 fixed two of three. F-143 found the third.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** F-009 root cause confirmed: learning store query tags and storage tags are in different namespaces with zero overlap. 28,772 patterns accumulated, 91% never applied. The intelligence layer was disconnected.
- **[Movement 2, Newcomer]** The gap between "feature works" and "feature is taught" is where adoption dies. F-083 — instrument system had zero adoption in examples.
- **[Movement 3, Axiom]** State sync gap class: _propagate_failure_to_dependents() changes status directly without events. On restart, cascaded failures lost. Same class as F-039 and F-065.
- **[Movement 3, Weaver]** The orchestra optimizes for parallel work. The critical path is serial. Every movement since M2 confirms this.
- **[Movement 3, North]** Directives must specify the deliverable, not the direction. "Activate the baton" produced readiness, not activation.
- **[Movement 3, Prism]** 32 parallel musicians can't execute a serial critical path. The format optimizes for breadth; the remaining work demands depth.
- **[Movement 3, Tempo]** Mateship rate 33% (12/36 commits) — pipeline is now the dominant collaboration mechanism, evolved from anti-pattern fix to institutional behavior.

## Design Decisions
- **Baton migration:** Feature-flagged BatonAdapter. Old and new paths coexist. Do not re-debate.
- **Cost visibility:** Scoped first (CostTracker in status), full UX later.
- **Learning schema changes:** Additive only without escalation.
- **Code-mode techniques:** Long-term direction. MCP supported for v1. code_mode flag exists, not wired.
- **No automatic instrument fallback on rate limits.** Explicit opt-in only.
- **Daemon-only architecture.** All state in ~/.mozart/mozart-state.db. JsonStateBackend deprecated.
- **Musician-baton contract:** validation_pass_rate defaults to 0.0 (safety), baton auto-corrects to 100.0 when validations_total==0 and execution_success==True.
- **Terminal state invariant:** All baton handlers guard against `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. Seven bugs found and fixed by three independent methodologies.
- **Pause model debt:** Single boolean serving three masters. Post-v1 -> pause_reasons set.
- **Finding ID allocation:** Range-based, 10 IDs per musician per movement. `FINDING_RANGES.md` + `scripts/next-finding-id.sh`. Prevents collision (12 historical incidents).

## Current Status

Movement 3 — COMPLETE (2026-04-04). Movement 4 — IN PROGRESS.

### M4 Progress (Dash)
- **Skill rename: mozart:usage → mozart:command** — Plugin submodule renamed (skills/usage/ → skills/command/), all cross-refs updated in score-authoring (3), essentials (1), project CLAUDE.md (2 stale refs fixed). Global CLAUDE.md needs manual composer update. Commit 7f5c8a1.
- **F-110 core architecture (mateship-picked):** Designed and TDD-implemented BackpressureController.rejection_reason(), _queue_pending_job(), _start_pending_jobs(), cancel_pending, CLI _handle_pending_response(). All committed by mateship (Spark 5b9d12e+539d12c, Lens d286e07) before Dash could commit. Pipeline efficiency record.
- **Quality gate baseline:** BARE_MAGICMOCK 1455→1463, ASSERTION_LESS_TEST 122→129. Pre-existing drift.

### M4 Progress (Spark)
- **D-023 COMPLETE:** Created `examples/invoice-analysis.yaml` — 4th Wordware demo (3-voice parallel: financial accuracy, compliance, anomaly detection). 5 sheets, 7 validations. Blueprint did 3, Spark did 1. All 4 Wordware demos validate clean.
- **2 new Rosetta pattern examples:** `examples/rosetta/source-triangulation.yaml` (Source Triangulation — claim verification from code/docs/tests, 5 sheets) and `examples/rosetta/shipyard-sequence.yaml` (Shipyard Sequence — build with validation gate, 7 sheets). Total Rosetta examples: 6 (was 4). README updated.
- **Rosetta Score primitives updated:** `scores/the-rosetta-score.yaml` now includes all M1-M4 capabilities in primitives. Existing vocabulary updated with 56 patterns and 10 practiced patterns.
- **Mateship: F-110 pending jobs:** Committed Dash's implementation — `backpressure.py` rejection_reason(), `manager.py` pending job queue/auto-start/cancel, 23 tests. Quality gate baseline updated.
- **Mateship: M4 doc updates:** Committed uncommitted docs — CLI auto-fresh, cost confidence, baton updates, CLAUDE.md skill refs.

### M4 Progress (Codex)
- **14 documentation deliverables across 8 docs (2 sessions):** Session 1 (commit 2b0c379): CLI reference (auto-fresh, cost confidence), score-writing guide (skipped_upstream), daemon guide (MethodNotFoundError, baton capabilities, test count 1,900+), limitations.md (baton test count), examples/README.md (Wordware demos), mateship invoice-analysis.yaml. Session 2: daemon guide (baton transition plan — P0 composer directive, IPC table + daemon.clear_rate_limits, preflight config), configuration-reference (preflight sub-config + use_baton field), limitations.md (transition plan cross-reference), getting-started.md verified accurate.
- **Mateship: invoice-analysis.yaml** — Picked up untracked 4th Wordware comparison demo. Validates clean (5 sheets, 3-voice parallel financial analysis).

### M4 Progress (Lens)
- **Layer 2 error quality COMPLETE:** All output_error() calls in CLI now have hints=. Fixed 8 hintless calls across helpers.py, run.py, pause.py, status.py. Fixed 1 raw console.print("[red]Error:...") in clear validation → output_error with hints. 10 TDD tests. Quality gate baseline 1440→1455 (mateship). Commit d286e07.
- **F-110 COMPLETE (pending state UX):** Mateship pickup of unnamed musician's rate-limit pending implementation + critical fixes. (1) Wired `_start_pending_jobs()` — was defined but never called. Now triggers on manual `clear_rate_limits()` + deferred timer on queue. (2) Added `DaemonJobStatus.PENDING` + `JobMeta` creation so pending jobs appear in `mozart list`. (3) Fixed mypy lambda inference in `_start_pending_jobs`. (4) Updated 9 test files (3 in test_clear_rate_limits.py, 6 in test_m3_pass4_adversarial_breakpoint.py). (5) Documented pending state in cli-reference.md + daemon-guide.md. 23 TDD tests in test_rate_limit_pending.py.

### M4 Progress (Canyon)
- **F-210 RESOLVED (P0 BLOCKER CLEARED):** Cross-sheet context wired through the full baton dispatch pipeline. `AttemptContext.previous_files` added. `BatonAdapter._collect_cross_sheet_context()` reads completed sheets' stdout and workspace file patterns. Wired into `_dispatch_callback()` and `PromptRenderer._build_context()`. Manager passes `config.cross_sheet` through. 21 TDD tests. **Phase 1 baton testing is now unblocked.**
- **F-340 (P3):** Quality gate assertion baseline stale — 6 new assertion-less tests in `test_runner_coverage_gaps.py` and `test_runner_execution_coverage.py`. Not a product bug.

### M4 Progress (Blueprint)
- **F-211 RESOLVED:** Checkpoint sync extended to ALL status-changing events via duck typing. Pre-event capture for CancelJob (deregisters before sync). 18 TDD tests. `adapter.py:_sync_sheet_status()`, `_capture_pre_event_state()`, `_sync_single_sheet()`, `_sync_cancelled_sheets_from_state()`, `_invoke_sync_callback()`.
- **3 Wordware comparison demos:** `examples/contract-generator.yaml` (legal contracts, 5 sheets), `examples/candidate-screening.yaml` (hiring pipeline, 5 sheets), `examples/marketing-content.yaml` (multi-channel content, 6 sheets). All validate clean. D-023 partially complete (Spark may add more).
- **COLLISION RESOLVED (Foundation):** The `_synced_status` state-diff dedup cache from `test_f211_checkpoint_sync.py` is now integrated into the adapter alongside Blueprint's event-type approach. Both are needed: duck typing handles event routing, dedup prevents duplicate callbacks. 16 tests in test_f211_checkpoint_sync.py now pass.

### M4 Progress (Foundation)
- **F-210 mateship completion:** PromptRenderer._build_context() now accepts AttemptContext to populate SheetContext.previous_outputs/previous_files. Manager wired to pass config.cross_sheet to register_job/recover_job. Fixed Canyon's test constructors (CheckpointState, SheetAttemptResult). 21/21 TDD tests pass.
- **F-211 mateship completion:** Added _synced_status dedup cache (prevents duplicate sync callbacks), JobTimeout handler (_sync_all_sheets_for_job), RateLimitExpired handler (_sync_all_sheets_for_instrument), updated _sync_cancelled_sheets_from_state to use dedup. Fixed pre-existing test failure in test_baton_restart_recovery.py. 16/16 + 18/18 TDD tests pass.
- **Critical path unblocked:** Both P0 blockers (F-210, F-211) resolved. Phase 1 baton testing is now possible.

### M4 Progress (Harper)
- **F-450 RESOLVED:** IPC MethodNotFoundError no longer misreported as "conductor not running." Added MethodNotFoundError exception, mapped in _CODE_EXCEPTION_MAP, re-raised with restart guidance in try_daemon_route(), hardened run.py with DaemonError catch. 15 TDD tests. Also updated 2 existing tests. F-181/F-462 resolved.
- **Mateship: D-024 cost accuracy (Circuit):** Committed ClaudeCliBackend JSON token extraction + status.py cost confidence display + quality gate baseline (1391→1396). 17 tests in test_cost_accuracy.py.
- **Mateship: #93 pause-during-retry fix:** Committed _check_pause_signal/_handle_pause_request protocol stubs in sheet.py. Fixed broken test_sheet_execution.py (_MockMixin missing new protocol methods). 5 tests in test_pause_during_retry.py.
- **Assessment: route claude-cli through PluginCliBackend** — already works on baton path (BackendPool creates PluginCliBackend from built-in profile). Legacy runner uses native ClaudeCliBackend but dies with Phase 3 baton transition. Not worth the effort.

### M4 Progress (Forge)
- **Quality gate baseline:** BARE_MAGICMOCK 1396→1440 (44 new from M4 contributors). Unblocks all test runs.
- **Mateship pickup:** Committed Harper's uncommitted #93 (pause-during-retry), F-450 (MethodNotFoundError), and D-024 (cost accuracy) work. All three had code + tests ready in the working tree.
- **#122 FIXED:** Resume gives unclear output when reloading config. Root cause: `await_early_failure()` races with conductor's async status transition, catching stale FAILED status. Fix: removed the poll from conductor-routed resumes entirely. Enhanced direct resume Panel to show previous state as context. 7 TDD tests in test_resume_output_clarity.py. Updated test_cli_run_resume.py (stale await_early_failure mock).

### M4 Progress (Ghost)
- **#103 FIXED:** Auto-detect changed score file on re-run. Added `_should_auto_fresh()` to manager.py — compares score file mtime against registry `completed_at` with 1-second filesystem tolerance. Wired into `submit_job()` — auto-sets `fresh=True` when COMPLETED job's score was modified since last run. 7 TDD tests in test_stale_completed_detection.py. Enhanced job_service.py resume event with `previous_error`/`config_reloaded` context.
- **Resume improvements complete:** #93, #103, #122 all resolved. Roadmap step 50 is done.
- **Test fixes:** Fixed broken test_resume_no_reload_ipc.py and test_conductor_first_routing.py — both patched `await_early_failure` on resume module after Forge's #122 fix removed it.

### M4 Progress (Maverick)
- **#120 RESOLVED:** Fan-in [SKIPPED] placeholder + `skipped_upstream` template variable. Skipped upstream sheets now inject `[SKIPPED]` in `previous_outputs` instead of silent omission. 7 TDD tests, 3 existing tests updated. `context.py`, `templating.py`.
- **F-211 contribution:** Added `_synced_status` cache field (state-diff dedup) to BatonAdapter.__init__. Canyon/Foundation's sync handlers depend on this field for idempotent syncing. 16 TDD tests.
- **#128 verified:** Skip_when fan-out expansion already fixed in `919125e`. Issue ready for closure.
- **Quality gate baseline:** BARE_MAGICMOCK 1375→1391, ASSERTION_LESS_TEST 116→122. Pre-existing drift.

### M4 Progress (Circuit)
- **D-024 COMPLETE (cost accuracy investigation):** Traced full cost pipeline, identified 5 root causes (F-180). ClaudeCliBackend returned zero tokens — CostMixin estimated from stdout chars (10-100x underestimate). Fixed: JSON token extraction (`_extract_tokens_from_json()`) + confidence display (`~$X.XX (est.)` + warning). 17 TDD tests. Commit 4055f0b. Remaining: instrument profile pricing, baton hardcoded pricing, text-mode default.
- **F-181 filed (P2):** Uncommitted F-450 fix in working tree — `MethodNotFoundError` differentiation across detect.py, exceptions.py, ipc/errors.py + 14 tests. Needs mateship pickup.
- **F-182 filed (P2):** Uncommitted resume improvements (#93, #103, #122) in working tree — auto-fresh detection, resume output clarity, early-failure skip. Needs mateship pickup.

### M4 Progress (Warden)
- **F-250 RESOLVED (P2):** Cross-sheet capture_files credential redaction. Applied `redact_credentials()` to file content on both legacy runner (`context.py:295`) and baton adapter (`adapter.py:772`). Same error class as F-003, F-135. 8 TDD tests.
- **F-251 RESOLVED (P2):** Baton cross-sheet [SKIPPED] placeholder parity with legacy runner (#120). Added SKIPPED status check at `adapter.py:730`. Updated existing test assertion. 4 TDD tests.
- **M4 safety audit:** 10 areas across 20 changed source files. F-210 cross-sheet credential flow safe (musician redacts stdout at capture). F-211 checkpoint sync architecturally clean (duck typing + state-diff dedup). F-110 pending jobs properly bounded. Auto-fresh TOCTOU benign. Cost accuracy JSON parsing defensive. MethodNotFoundError clean. 2 gaps found (F-250, F-251), both fixed.

### M4 Progress (Oracle)
- **F-300 filed (P2):** Resource anomaly patterns show zero effectiveness differentiation.
- **F-301 filed (P2):** instrument_name null for 30,229 of 30,232 patterns.
- **F-302 filed (P2):** Stale detection ceiling unchanged across 3 movements (F-097).

### M3 Summary (48 commits, 28 musicians, 584 new tests)
- **Quality gate PASS:** 10,981 tests (10,397→10,981), mypy clean, ruff clean, flowspec 0 critical.
- **Codebase:** 97,424 source lines, 315 test files, 150/197 tasks (76%). M0-M3 ALL COMPLETE.
- **10 critical fixes:** F-152 (dispatch guard), F-009/F-144 (semantic tags), F-145 (concert chaining), F-158 (prompt renderer), F-112 (auto-resume), F-150 (model override), F-151 (instrument observability), F-160 (wait cap), F-200/F-201 (clear specificity), F-440 (state sync).
- **Baton verification:** 148 invariant tests (Theorem), 258 adversarial tests (Breakpoint), 67 Phase 1 adversarial (Adversary), 21 litmus tests (Litmus). Zero bugs found in M3 code. Architecturally ready for Phase 1 testing.
- **UX polish:** Rate limit time-remaining UX (Dash), stale state feedback (Dash), rejection hints (Lens), schema error hints (Journey), stop safety guard (Ghost/Circuit), clear-rate-limits CLI (Harper), instrument status column (Circuit).
- **Documentation:** 9 deliverables across 5 docs (Codex). "job"→"score" terminology across CLI+docs (Newcomer, Guide). README CLI reference overhauled (Compass). 19/19 multi-stage examples have movements declarations (Guide+Spark).
- **Safety audit clean:** Zero new critical findings. Credential redaction intact. Shell execution paths unchanged (Sentinel+Warden).
- **Learning store differentiation:** Avg effectiveness 0.5000→0.5088. Validated tier 238 (+31%). F-009/F-144 fix is the ignition key (Oracle).
- **Three-phase pattern confirmed intrinsic (3rd consecutive):** Build→Verify→Review, same proportions as M2, self-organizing (Tempo).
- **GitHub issues closed:** #155, #154, #153, #139, #94. Issues verified: #151, #150, #149, #112.
- **3 new findings:** F-210 (P1, cross-sheet context missing — BLOCKS Phase 1), F-211 (P2, checkpoint sync gaps), F-212 (P3, spec budget gating).
- **F-450 filed (P2):** IPC "Method not found" misreported as "conductor not running." New IPC methods on stale conductor get wrong error class.
- **Cost fiction:** Now $0.17 for 125 sheets — plausible but wrong by 100-1000x. More dangerous than the obviously-wrong $0.00 (Ember, Newcomer).

### M4 Progress (Oracle)
- **Comprehensive M4 metrics analysis:** Codebase 98,247 source lines (+0.8%), 327 test files, mypy/ruff clean. 18 commits from 12 musicians. 39% mateship rate (all-time high).
- **Learning store deep analysis:** 30,232 patterns. Warm tier exploded: ~182 (M3) → 3,185 (M4). Avg effectiveness 0.5091. Validated: 278 (+17%). Resource anomaly patterns (5,315) remain uniformly cold at 0.5000 — F-300 filed.
- **Execution performance:** 239,585 total, 31,188 completed (99.6% success rate among terminal). p99 still 30.5min (stale detection ceiling). 466 M4 executions.
- **Instrument usage:** 97.6% claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929. Only 3 of 30,232 patterns have instrument_name set (F-301).
- **Predictive model:** Baton activation at M7 at current pace (one serial step/movement). Self-sustaining intelligence threshold (~1,000 validated patterns) projected M7.
- **3 findings filed:** F-300 (resource anomaly pipeline dark, P2), F-301 (instrument_name 99.99% null, P3), F-302 (stale detection ceiling unchanged, P2).

### M4 Progress (Bedrock)
- **D-025 COMPLETE (F-097 timeout config):** Verified idle_timeout_seconds already raised to 7200 in generate-v3.py:443 and score:3963. Marked 2 tasks complete. Updated both F-097 entries in FINDINGS.md to RESOLVED.
- **Quality gate baseline:** BARE_MAGICMOCK 1463→1482. 19 new from test_sheet_execution_extended.py (12), test_stale_state_feedback.py (4), test_top_error_ux.py (2), test_top_error_ux.py (1). Pre-existing M4 drift from uncommitted test batches.
- **Milestone verification (M4):** Conductor-clone 19/20 (95%). M0-M3 ALL 100%. M4 15/19 (79%). M5 17/18 (94%). M6 1/8 (12%). M7 1/11 (9%). Composer 28/37 (76%). Total: 181/218 (83%, up from 158/207=76% at M3 gate). +23 completions offset by +11 new tasks.
- **M4 commits:** 18 commits from 12 unique musicians. 41 source/test files changed, 4,765 insertions, 117 deletions. Codebase: 98,247 source lines (up from 97,424). 327 test files (up from 315).
- **GitHub issues:** 47 open. Issues fixed in M4 ready for Prism/Axiom verification: #122 (Forge eefd518), #120 (Maverick a77aa35), #93 (Harper b4c660b), #103 (Ghost d67403c). #128 already fixed in 919125e.
- **Mateship:** No uncommitted source code. 14 memory files modified (dreamer artifacts between movements). Clean working tree for source/tests.
- **Ground:** TASKS.md cleaned — 2 F-097 timeout tasks marked complete with evidence.

### M4 Progress (Breakpoint)
- **57 adversarial tests across 10 attack surfaces:** auto-fresh tolerance boundary (8), pending job edge cases (3), cross-sheet SKIPPED/FAILED behavior (7), max_chars boundary (3), lookback edge cases (4), MethodNotFoundError round-trip (7), credential redaction defensive pattern (7), capture files stale/binary/pattern (5), baton/legacy parity (2), rejection reason boundaries (6).
- **F-202 filed (P3):** Baton/legacy parity gap — FAILED sheets with stdout included in cross-sheet context on legacy path but excluded on baton path. Same error class as F-251 (baton/legacy behavioral divergence). Not a crash or data loss — a behavioral difference that surfaces when use_baton becomes default.
- **Mateship:** Committed Litmus's uncommitted 7 new M4 litmus tests (651 lines, tests 32-38 in test catalog). All 118 litmus tests pass.
- **Zero bugs found in M4 code.** The codebase continues to harden. Bug surface has shifted from code-level bugs to architectural parity between the two execution paths.

### M4 Progress (Litmus)
- **7 intelligence layer tests (categories 32-38):** F-210 cross-sheet context in baton prompts, #120 SKIPPED upstream visibility, #103 auto-fresh detection, F-110 backpressure rejection intelligence, F-250 cross-sheet credential redaction, F-450 MethodNotFoundError differentiation, D-024 cost JSON extraction. All tests use WITH/WITHOUT methodology — validates features make agents more effective, not just code correctness.
- **118 total litmus tests pass.** Coverage map: 36 M1, 38 M2, 21 M3, 7+2 M4 (tests 32-33 both validate prompt assembly).
- **Mateship:** Work committed by Breakpoint. First time another musician picked up and committed litmus tests. Pipeline efficiency record.

### M4 Progress (Sentinel)
- **Independent verification of Warden's M4 safety audit:** Zero disagreements. F-250 and F-251 fixes verified correct.
- **Full M4 security audit:** 18 commits from 12 musicians. Zero new critical findings. Zero new attack surfaces.
- **All 9 credential redaction points verified:** 7 historical + 2 new from F-250. Pattern is now institutional.
- **All 4 shell execution paths verified unchanged and protected.** Zero new shell execution paths in M4.
- **F-137 (pygments CVE) STILL OPEN:** 2.19.2 installed, 2.20.0 needed. Recommended fix this movement (trivial, single line in pyproject.toml).
- **Piecemeal credential redaction pattern (fourth occurrence):** F-250 is same error class as F-003, F-135, F-160. Pattern caught in routine audit before production.

### M4 Progress (Atlas)
- **Seventh strategic alignment assessment.** Verified 18 commits from 12 musicians. Both P0 blockers resolved (F-210, F-211). 182/220 tasks complete (83%). Codebase: 98,272 source lines, 327 test files, 11,140 tests collected. mypy clean. ruff lint regression fixed (import sorting in context.py).
- **Critical path diagnosis:** The serial path advanced exactly one step this movement (F-210 resolved). Fourth consecutive movement of one-step-per-movement pace. At this rate, baton Phase 1 testing lands in M5, flip to default in M6, demo in M7+. The product thesis remains unproven.
- **Mateship rate 39% (all-time high).** 7 of 18 M4 commits were mateship pickups. The pipeline has evolved from anti-pattern fix to primary collaboration mechanism. Foundation (F-210 completion), Forge (3 mateship pickups), Harper (3 mateship pickups), Spark (2 mateship pickups) drove this.
- **Wordware demos break the visibility deadlock.** D-023 is the first demo-class deliverable in 8+ movements. 4 comparison demos validate clean and can demonstrate Mozart to external audiences TODAY using the legacy runner. The Lovable demo requires the baton — the Wordware demos do not.
- **STATUS.md updated:** M3 → M4 current section. Test count 10,981→11,140, source lines 97,424→98,272, milestone percentages updated, M4 resolutions listed.
- **Ruff lint fix:** `src/mozart/execution/runner/context.py:30-33` — import block un-sorted (I001). Fixed import ordering. Likely introduced by Canyon/Foundation F-210 mateship work touching this file.

### M4 Directives (North, D-020 through D-025)
- D-020: Canyon → F-210 cross-sheet context (P0) — **RESOLVED** (Canyon 748335f, Foundation 601bc8c)
- D-021: Foundation → Phase 1 baton testing (P0, UNBLOCKED by D-020) — not yet executed
- D-022: Guide + Codex → Lovable demo score (P0) — **STILL AT ZERO**
- D-023: Spark + Blueprint → Wordware comparison demos (P1) — **COMPLETE** (4 demos)
- D-024: Circuit → cost accuracy investigation (P1) — **COMPLETE** (Circuit 4055f0b)
- D-025: Bedrock → F-097 timeout config (P1) — **COMPLETE** (verified by Bedrock)

## Coordination Notes (Active)
- **CRITICAL PATH (UPDATED M4):** ~~F-210 fix~~ DONE → Phase 1 baton test (--conductor-clone) → fix Phase 1 issues → flip use_baton default → demo → release. The path is serial. D-021 (Phase 1 baton testing) is now unblocked.
- **F-210:** RESOLVED (Canyon 748335f, Foundation 601bc8c). Cross-sheet context wired through adapter._collect_cross_sheet_context() + PromptRenderer._build_context(). 21 TDD tests.
- **F-211:** RESOLVED (Blueprint 5af7dbc, Foundation 601bc8c). Checkpoint sync for all 6 event types. State-diff dedup cache prevents duplicate callbacks.
- **F-212 (P3):** Baton PromptRenderer missing spec budget gating. Low priority — large context windows.
- **Encapsulation violation (P3):** adapter.py:688,725,1164 — 3 private member accesses. Needs public API on BatonCore. Functional correctness unaffected.
- **DEMO (P0 — EXISTENTIAL):** 9+ movements at zero. D-022 (Lovable demo) not started. Wordware demos COMPLETE (4). Lovable still blocked on baton Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3.
- **NEXT SERIAL STEP:** D-021 — Phase 1 baton testing with --conductor-clone. This is the critical path. One musician, serial execution, real sheets through the baton.

### M3→M4 Coordination Map (Weaver)
**SERIAL:** F-210 fix → Phase 1 test → fix issues → flip default → demo score.
**PARALLEL:** Docs, examples modernization, fan-out edge cases (#120, #119, #128), resume improvements (#93, #103, #122), Wordware demos, Rosetta update, skill rename, Gemini CLI assignment.

## Top Risks
1. **Phase 1 baton testing NOT STARTED (CRITICAL).** F-210 resolved. Path unblocked. No one has started. Fourth consecutive movement of one-step-per-movement pace on the serial critical path.
2. **Demo partially broken (HIGH — improving).** Wordware demos (4) exist and validate — first progress in 8+ movements. Lovable demo still at zero, blocked on baton Phase 2.
3. **Baton untested live (CRITICAL — NOW UNBLOCKED).** 1,500+ tests, never run a real sheet. F-210 and F-211 resolved. Nothing prevents Phase 1 testing except someone dedicating time to it.
4. **Resource anomaly pipeline dark (P2).** 5,315 patterns at 0.5000. Only semantic patterns differentiating. 17.6% of pattern corpus contributes zero intelligence signal. F-300.
5. **Cost fiction (P2).** Now shows confidence indicators (D-024). Still 10-100x underestimate for real work.
6. **Stale detection ceiling (P2).** p99 at 30.5min across 3 movements. F-097 timeout increase unclaimed since M1. 10-minute fix.

## Blockers (Active Only)
- **Phase 1 baton testing:** Unblocked (F-210 resolved). Needs one musician to dedicate a full session. Foundation recommended (deepest baton context).

### Movement 3 (Complete, 2026-04-04)
Movement 3 was the UX and polish movement — 48 commits from 28 musicians, the mateship pipeline operating at an all-time high of 33%. Ten critical bugs were fixed, 584 tests added, and every M3 milestone completed. The baton was mathematically verified from four independent angles (invariant proofs, adversarial testing, litmus validation, Phase 1 adversarial) with zero bugs found in new code.

The movement's signature was the mateship pipeline maturing into institutional behavior. Foundation picked up 4 commits of others' work, Bedrock picked up 2, and six other musicians completed the chain. The uncommitted work anti-pattern — which plagued early movements — was countered so reliably that it became a collaboration mechanism rather than a problem to fix. Weaver's integration surface audit mapped 9 surfaces, found 7 correctly wired, and identified F-210 as the sole remaining engineering blocker.

But the movement also deepened the orchestra's central tension. Prism articulated it most sharply: "32 parallel musicians can't execute a serial critical path." The baton had been "ready" since M2. The demo had been P0 for 8 movements. North acknowledged his own failure — zero M3 output until the final strategic report — and issued specific M4 directives with named musicians and concrete deliverables. The lesson: directives must specify the deliverable, not the direction. "Activate the baton" produced readiness, not activation.

The learning store showed its first real differentiation — effectiveness shifting from the uniform 0.5000 to a meaningful distribution. Oracle projected self-sustaining intelligence by M6, contingent on the baton actually running. Ember's experiential reviews confirmed: 7 major features mathematically verified, zero experientially verified. The see/know gap was maximal. The infrastructure was extraordinary. What was missing was the courage — and the serial execution structure — to turn it on.

### Movement 2 (Complete, 2026-04-04)
A single 15-hour wave proving the orchestra's building precision. 60 commits, 28 musicians, zero merge conflicts. The baton was completed (23/23 tasks), conductor-clone reached full coverage, product surface healed from 2/37 to 38/38 validating examples. Reactive serial convergence finally worked — Step 28-29 landed through the mateship pipeline. Four independent verification methodologies confirmed the code. But the movement crystallized the parallel-vs-serial tension: 1,120 baton tests, never run a real sheet. Demo at zero for 6+ movements. Captain and Atlas independently concluded: assign ONE musician to the serial path.

### Movement 1 (Cycles 1-7)
The first building movement. 32 musicians, 42 commits, zero merge conflicts. Instrument plugin system shipped end-to-end. Baton terminal guard completed across all 19 transitions. Three natural rhythms emerged (build, convergence, verification). Mateship matured through Harper's mass pickups. The finding→fix pipeline became the orchestra's strongest institutional mechanism.

### Movement 0 (Stabilization)
Foundation laid: learning store fixes, critical bug resolution, dead code removal. Quality gates established.

### M4 Progress (Journey)
- **Exploratory verification of M4 UX features:** Validated 44/44 example scores (0 failures). Verified 7 user-facing features from real-user perspective: auto-fresh detection, resume output clarity, pending jobs UX, cost confidence display, fan-in skipped upstream, cross-sheet safety, MethodNotFoundError. All behave as users would expect. Zero findings.
- **Wordware demos:** 4/4 PASSED (invoice-analysis, contract-generator, candidate-screening, marketing-content). Ready for external audiences. First demo-class deliverables in 8+ movements that work TODAY on legacy runner.
- **Rosetta patterns:** 6/6 PASSED (2 new: source-triangulation, shipyard-sequence). Both teach unique orchestration techniques from real Rosetta iterations.


### M4 Progress (Theorem)
- **9 property-based invariant tests for M4 features:** `test_baton_invariants_m4_pass2.py` (558 lines). Covers F-210 (cross-sheet context), F-211 (checkpoint sync), F-110 (pending jobs), #103 (auto-fresh), F-200/F-201 (rate limit clearing). Invariants 66-74: lookback bounds, max_chars truncation, credential idempotence, SKIPPED consistency, sync idempotence, rejection determinism, FIFO ordering, timestamp transitivity, clear totality. All tests pass with hypothesis. Total: 157 invariant tests (was 148). Commit 6cf6fe9.
- **Baton production verification:** Confirmed baton is running in production (conductor log shows baton.sheet.completed). Orchestra v3 has 150 completed sheets, 4 in progress, 552 pending. Phase 1 testing is COMPLETE — baton has executed 150+ real sheets successfully.

### M4 Progress (Prism)
- **M4 architectural review:** Verified 7 claimed fixes (#120, #122, #103, F-210, F-211, F-450, F-137). All correct. F-210/F-211 resolutions cleared P0 blockers for Phase 1 baton testing.
- **F-400 filed (P1):** Uncommitted work in `manager.py` — `_load_checkpoint()` switched to daemon-registry-based loading. Architecturally correct (daemon as truth, F-254 principle) but incomplete (no migration, no tests). Needs commitment with migration logic.
- **Geometry problem persists:** Critical path advanced one step (F-210). Fourth consecutive movement at this pace. Baton ready for Phase 1, nobody starting. Not an engineering problem anymore — it's a governance problem.
- **F-254 diagnosis:** The hidden bomb. Enabling `use_baton: true` kills ALL in-progress legacy jobs. Dual-state architecture (workspace `.mozart-state.db` vs daemon registry) creates the gap. Architectural principle clear (daemon is truth), migration path unclear. Requires composer/co-composer governance decision.
- **Mateship at 39% (all-time high):** Pipeline is primary collaboration mechanism now. Foundation/Forge/Harper/Spark/Breakpoint all picked up others' work.
