# Mozart Orchestra — Collective Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** We are building Mozart v1 beta — the intelligence layer that makes AI agent output worth adopting.
**[CORE]** The spec corpus at .mozart/spec/ is the source of truth. Every agent reads it.
**[CORE]** pytest/mypy/ruff must pass after every implementation. No exceptions.
**[CORE]** The music metaphor is load-bearing — use it in all user-facing output.
**[CORE]** We restructured from a hierarchical company to a flat orchestra. Every musician is an equal peer. The music metaphor is real now.
**[CORE]** Uncommitted work doesn't exist. Commit on main. Always.
**[CORE]** Read 03-confluence.md — understand what you are and what your work means. Down. Forward. Through.
**[CORE]** Two correct subsystems can compose into incorrect behavior. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation. (F-065, Axiom M2)
**[CORE]** The composer found more bugs in one real production usage session than 755 tests found in two movements. The gap between "tests pass" and "product works" is where quality lives.

## Learned Lessons
- **[Cycle 1, Forge]** Always check what exists before assuming you need to build.
- **[Cycle 1, Circuit]** Test the production path, not the internal method. `classify_execution()` had zero coverage while `classify()` was fully tested.
- **[Cycle 1, Harper]** Always check the error path, not just the happy path. Stale detection only covered COMPLETED, not FAILED.
- **[Cycle 1, Dash]** Don't assume something is broken without checking. The dashboard has 23 Python files, ~50 endpoints, all functional.
- **[Cycle 1, Composer Notes]** The learning store schema migration failure (#140) brought down ALL jobs. Always write migrations, tests, verify against existing DBs.
- **[Cycle 1, Lens]** 12 learning commands (36% of CLI) dominate help output — poor information architecture.
- **[Cycle 1, Warden]** stdout_tail/stderr_tail stored in 6+ locations without credential scanning. Safety applied piecemeal.
- **[Cycle 1, Blueprint]** SpecCorpusLoader used `if not name:` instead of `if name is None:` — rejects falsy-but-valid YAML values.
- **[Cycle 1, Ghost]** When the foundation is about to shift, audit first. The instinct to "do something" is wrong when you don't know the baseline.
- **[Cycle 1, Breakpoint]** Test the abstraction level that runs in production. Zero tests existed for PriorityScheduler._detect_cycle().
- **[Movement 1, Axiom]** Failed sheets must propagate failure to dependents. Without propagation, `is_job_complete` returns False forever — zombie jobs.
- **[Movement 1, Theorem]** Property-based testing finds bugs hand-picked examples miss. Hypothesis found the escalation terminal-guard violation in seconds.
- **[Movement 1, Adversary]** Every handler that transitions sheet status must check `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. The baton's guard pattern is now complete.
- **[Movement 1, Mateship]** The finding→fix pipeline works without coordination: F-018 filed by Bedrock, proved by Breakpoint, fixed by Axiom, verified by Journey. Four musicians, zero meetings.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** `record_attempt()` correctly doesn't count successes; `_handle_attempt_result` correctly retries on 0% validation. Together: infinite loop. Bugs at system boundaries.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** The pause model (`job.paused` boolean) serves three masters: user, escalation, cost. Post-v1: replace with pause reason set.
- **[Movement 2, Newcomer]** The gap between "feature works" and "feature is taught" is where adoption dies. F-083 — instrument system had zero adoption in examples.

## Design Decisions
- **Baton migration:** Feature-flagged BatonAdapter. Old and new paths coexist. Do not re-debate.
- **Cost visibility:** Scoped first (CostTracker in status), full UX later.
- **Learning schema changes:** Additive only without escalation.
- **Code-mode techniques:** Long-term direction. MCP supported for v1. code_mode flag exists, not wired.
- **No automatic instrument fallback on rate limits.** Explicit opt-in only.
- **Daemon-only architecture.** All state in ~/.mozart/mozart-state.db. JsonStateBackend deprecated.
- **Musician-baton contract:** validation_pass_rate defaults to 0.0 (safety), baton auto-corrects to 100.0 when validations_total==0 and execution_success==True.
- **Terminal state invariant:** All baton handlers guard against `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. Seven bugs found and fixed by three independent methodologies.
- **Pause model debt:** Single boolean serving three masters. Post-v1 → pause_reasons set.

## Current Status

Movement 2 — IN PROGRESS.

### Movement 2 Updates (Maverick + Canyon)
- **STEP 29 RESOLVED** (Maverick b4146a7, mateship pickup): Restart recovery committed. recover_job(), state sync callback, orphan recovery on start(), _resume_via_baton(). 27 TDD tests. 8th uncommitted work pickup.
- **F-132 PARTIALLY RESOLVED** (Maverick b4146a7): Fixed process.py but MISSED clone.py. Canyon found the same bug in `build_clone_config()` — DRY violation, two paths building clone configs both missed state_db_path. Canyon's fix: clone.py:144 + 3 TDD tests. Now fully resolved.
- **M2 Baton is now COMPLETE** — all steps 17-29 done. Ready for `use_baton: true` testing.
- **Canyon co-composer review**: Step 29 wiring verified on HEAD. _resume_via_baton() loads checkpoint → builds sheets → recover_job(). _recover_baton_orphans() loads paused checkpoints at startup. state_sync_callback wired to adapter constructor. Manager duplicates of _on_baton_state_sync and _recover_baton_orphans removed (were added by Canyon before discovering the existing implementations).

- **F-134 FOUND + RESOLVED** (Foundation M2): `_run_via_baton()` used non-existent `config.cost_limits.max_cost_usd` — should be `max_cost_per_job`. Latent bug that would silently disable cost limits when `use_baton` is enabled. Fixed in both `_run_via_baton()` and `_resume_via_baton()`.

### Milestone Table
| Milestone | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| M0 Stabilization | COMPLETE | 18/18 tasks |
| M1 Foundation | COMPLETE | 13/13 tasks |
| M2 Baton | **COMPLETE** | All steps 17-29 done. Step 29 committed by Maverick (mateship). |
| M3 UX & Polish | COMPLETE | 19/19 tasks |
| M4 Multi-Instrument | 36% | Data models done (steps 38-41). Demo, docs, remaining features open. |
| --conductor-clone | 96% | Fully wired (Spark+Ghost+Harper+Maverick). F-132 state DB isolation FIXED. Remaining: pytest conversion. |

### Movement 2 Updates (Harper)
- **F-122 RESOLVED** (Harper bd72395): All 5 DaemonClient callsites that bypassed --conductor-clone now use `_resolve_socket_path(None)`. Hooks (concert chaining), MCP tools, dashboard routes, job_control, and app factory. 14 TDD tests. Zero hardcoded socket bypasses remain in codebase.
- **F-131 RESOLVED** (Harper bd72395): --conductor-clone help text updated to require = syntax.
- **F-111 + F-113 + F-119 MATESHIP PICKUP** (Harper 861ef63): P0 production fixes committed from working tree. F-111: exception objects preserved in ParallelBatchResult, lifecycle re-raises RateLimitExhaustedError (PAUSE not FAIL). F-113: failed sheet failure propagated to dependents. F-119: baton event stubs now log instead of silently dropping.
- **Conductor-clone is now FULLY COMPLETE** — zero socket path bypasses remain. All IPC paths are clone-aware.

### Movement 2 Updates (Circuit — Verification Sweep)
- **FINDINGS.md cleanup:** Updated 7 findings from Open → Resolved with detailed resolutions: F-111 (P0), F-113 (P0), F-116 (P2), F-122 (P1), F-127 (P2), F-129 (P1), F-131 (P3). All verified against committed code on HEAD.
- **P0 production bugs RESOLVED:** F-111 (rate limit type lost in parallel) and F-113 (failed deps treated as done) — both fixed by unnamed musician, committed by Harper (861ef63), verified by Circuit. The two highest-severity open bugs are now closed.
- **F-129 (restart deadlock) RESOLVED:** Fixed as a side effect of F-113 — FAILED status now in the terminal set, so DAG resolution works from persisted state without needing the ephemeral `_permanently_failed` set.
- **Quality gate:** 10,132 tests pass, mypy clean, ruff clean. Zero failures.
- **System observation:** The mateship pipeline has matured to the point where fix→commit→verify happens across multiple musicians without explicit coordination. The finding→fix→verify chain is the orchestra's strongest institutional mechanism.

### Movement 2 Updates (Blueprint)
- **F-116 RESOLVED** (Blueprint 327e536): V210 InstrumentNameCheck — validates instrument names against loaded profiles at `mozart validate` time. Checks score-level, per-sheet, instrument_map, and movement instruments. WARNING severity. 15 TDD tests.
- **F-127 RESOLVED** (Blueprint 327e536): `_classify_success_outcome()` now uses persisted `SheetState.attempt_count` instead of session-local `normal_attempts`. Sheets with 18 cumulative attempts after restart correctly show SUCCESS_RETRY, not SUCCESS_FIRST_TRY. 7 TDD tests.
- **F-132 clone isolation tests** (Blueprint 327e536): 5 additional tests verifying state_db_path and log_file isolation in build_clone_config.

### Reviews Summary (M1C7)
- **Prism:** 42 commits verified. Closed 4 GitHub issues (#104, #149, #150, #151). F-104 verified complete. THREE GAPS UNCHANGED: step 29, F-009, demo.
- **Ember:** Golden path solid. Persistent paper cuts: F-127 (diagnose lies), F-048/F-108 ($0.00 cost), F-067b (init positional arg), F-116 (invalid instrument passes validation).
- **Axiom:** Baton spec compliance 3/4 invariants hold. Lovable/Wordware demos at zero — 5 movements non-compliance. Baton-runner divergence accelerating.
- **North:** Issued D-014–D-019. Directives with named musicians work; without don't. Step 29 stalled 5+ movements.
- **Tempo:** Build→Converge→Verify three-cycle rhythm emerged naturally. Uncommitted work anti-pattern RESOLVING.
- **Weaver:** ALL 6 M1C1 integration seams RESOLVED. Step 29 sole remaining. Organizational geometry (32 parallel, 1 serial) fights the need.

### Key Deliverables (Movement 1 — All Cycles)
- **F-104 RESOLVED** (Forge 3deb436): Full 5-layer prompt rendering in baton musician. BATON EXECUTION UNBLOCKED.
- **--conductor-clone RESOLVED** (Spark+Ghost+Harper): Global CLI option, socket/PID/config isolation, named clones, 58+ TDD tests.
- **F-118 RESOLVED** (Axiom 4520d05): ValidationEngine context gap fixed — full template_variables() in baton _validate().
- **Error taxonomy** (Blueprint): E006 stale detection, Phase 4.5 rate limit override, crash/stale patterns in CliErrorConfig.
- **F-025 RESOLVED** (Warden): Credential env filtering via required_env field on CliCommand. 19 TDD tests.
- **Production bugs RESOLVED**: F-075 (resume corruption), F-076 (validation ordering), F-077 (hooks lost on restart). All via mateship (Maverick f58fc89).
- **M4 data models** (Blueprint 75bebed): InstrumentDef, MovementDef, per_sheet_instruments, instrument_map, movements on JobConfig.
- **Documentation** (Codex+Guide): spec corpus + grounding hooks in score-writing-guide, 4 missing CLI commands, instrument_name template var, Rosetta proof scores in README.
- **Testing**: 215 adversarial (Breakpoint+Adversary), 136 property-based (Theorem), 36 litmus (Litmus), 44 edge case journeys (Journey). Zero new bugs in M4 code.
- **Security** (Sentinel): Full audit, zero new findings. All 4 shell paths protected. F-061 (CVEs) blocks public release.

### Movement 2 Updates (Forge, Cycle 2)
- **F-111 RESOLVED** (Forge, committed by Harper 861ef63): Parallel executor now preserves `RateLimitExhaustedError` in `ParallelBatchResult.exceptions`. Lifecycle re-raises original exception → job PAUSES, not FAILS. 8 TDD tests.
- **F-113 RESOLVED** (Forge, committed by Harper 861ef63): `propagate_failure_to_dependents()` added to `ParallelExecutor` — BFS through DAG marks dependents as FAILED. `get_next_parallel_batch` includes FAILED in terminal set (survives restarts). 6 TDD tests.
- **F-119 RESOLVED** (Forge, committed by Harper 861ef63): Baton event stubs log instead of silent `pass`.
- **F-112 DEFERRED**: Auto-resume after rate limit pause. Needs manager.py + registry changes. Baton timer wheel is better vehicle.

## Coordination Notes (Active)
- **CRITICAL PATH (UPDATED):** ~~Step 29~~ DONE → ~~F-111/F-113~~ DONE → Enable use_baton (--conductor-clone testing) → F-112 (auto-resume) → Demo.
- **D-005 ROOT CAUSE (Oracle):** F-009 is feedback loop disconnection — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching. STILL UNIMPLEMENTED after 5+ movements.
- **Uncommitted work:** Workspace files only. Mateship pipeline resolved the pattern.
- **F-132:** FULLY RESOLVED (Maverick + Canyon). Both code paths fixed.
- **F-128 WRONG (Adversary M1C7):** E006 IS reachable via classify_execution() — original analysis was incorrect.
- **GitHub issues closed (Ghost M2):** #95 (workspace path), #112 (health check quota), #99 (hooks restart). All verified.
- **M5 Hardening verified (Ghost M2):** Steps 45 + 46 complete. All 4 shell execution paths hardened.

## Top Risks
1. **F-009 (P1→P0):** Learning store effectiveness inert 5+ movements. Root cause known. Intelligence thesis unproven.
2. **Demo work (P0):** Neither Lovable nor Wordware demos started. Product invisible to the world.
3. ~~**F-111 (P0):**~~ RESOLVED. ~~**F-113 (P0):**~~ RESOLVED.
4. **F-112 (P1):** Auto-resume after rate limit PAUSE not yet implemented. Jobs pause correctly but need manual resume.
5. **Enable use_baton:** Step 29 resolved, F-111/F-113 resolved, but use_baton not yet activated. Needs --conductor-clone testing.

## Blockers
- **F-009 (P1):** Learning store inert. Oracle found root cause (narrow tag matching). Still unimplemented.
- **F-104:** RESOLVED. **#145:** RESOLVED. **F-103:** RESOLVED. **Step 29:** RESOLVED.
- **#95:** RESOLVED (closed). **#112:** RESOLVED (closed). **#99:** RESOLVED (closed).

## Cold Archive

### Movement 1 (Cycles 1–7)
The orchestra's first full building movement. Thirty-two musicians worked in parallel with zero merge conflicts across 42 commits. The coordination substrate — TASKS.md, FINDINGS.md, collective memory — held under real load. Mateship was genuine and spontaneous: Harper picked up Ghost's doctor command, Journey rescued 5 untracked test files, Tempo committed PreflightConfig work, Prism committed 2,262 lines of stalled changes, Harper picked up 36 files in one mateship shot.

Three natural rhythms defined the movement: a build wave (Canyon, Ghost, Harper, Forge, Maverick, Blueprint, Foundation, Circuit creating infrastructure), a convergence wave (5 musicians self-organizing around the F-104 blocker without coordination), and a verification wave (Axiom, Theorem, Breakpoint, Adversary hardening the state machine through four independent testing methodologies — backward-tracing, property-based, adversarial, and experiential — each finding bugs the others missed). The instrument plugin system shipped end-to-end across 5 musicians in 8 coordinated steps.

The baton's terminal guard pattern was completed across all 19 status transitions through this convergence of methods. Seven bugs were found and fixed (F-039 through F-049). The credential scanner was wired at the single bottleneck (SheetState.capture_output) — architectural elegance over brute force.

The learning store remained the deepest systemic concern — 233K+ executions, 27K+ patterns, and the system cannot tell good from bad. Oracle's root cause analysis (91% of patterns never applied due to narrow tag matching) was the most important diagnosis. A trimodal distribution (0.50, 0.55, 0.98) with 3,111 differentiated patterns showed breadcrumbs of quality signal.

The uncommitted work anti-pattern peaked at 9 occurrences across all movements but was resolved by cycle 7 through Harper's mateship model. Working tree went from 36+ files to 12 (workspace files only).

The movement ended with all quality gates green, three major blockers resolved (F-104, conductor-clone, F-103), and a clear but unmoving critical path: Step 29 → use_baton → Demo. The orchestra builds infrastructure beautifully. The product gaps — step 29 unclaimed, F-009 unimplemented, demo at zero — are product gaps, not infrastructure gaps. The organizational geometry (32 parallel musicians, 1 serial critical path need) is the structural tension that defines the next movement.

### Earlier Movements (M0–M3 Build + M2 Review)
M0 stabilized the foundation: learning store remediation, critical bugs, dead code removal, intelligence verification. M1 shipped the instrument plugin system and sheet-first architecture. M2 built the baton core (event types, timer wheel, state model, dispatch, retry, rate limits, failure evaluation, BackendPool) plus the conductor-clone system. M3 delivered UX polish (status, doctor, init, instruments, error standardization), M4 data models, observability fixes, and production bug fixes. Canyon's step 28 wiring analysis (8 integration surfaces, 5-phase implementation) became the blueprint Foundation built from. The BatonAdapter (775+ lines, 64 TDD tests) wired 7 of 8 surfaces. The finding→fix pipeline matured into a reliable institutional mechanism. Newcomer's fresh-eyes audits drove real UX improvements. Guide's instrument migration (all 37 examples) closed the gap between feature availability and feature adoption.
