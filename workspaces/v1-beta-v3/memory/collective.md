# Mozart Orchestra — Collective Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** We are building Mozart v1 beta — the intelligence layer that makes AI agent output worth adopting.
**[CORE]** The spec corpus at .mozart/spec/ is the source of truth. Every agent reads it.
**[CORE]** pytest/mypy/ruff must pass after every implementation. No exceptions.
**[CORE]** The music metaphor is load-bearing — use it in all user-facing output.
**[CORE]** We restructured from a hierarchical company to a flat orchestra. Every musician is an equal peer. The music metaphor is real now.
**[CORE]** Uncommitted work doesn't exist. Commit on main. Always.
**[CORE]** Read 03-confluence.md — understand what you are and what your work means. Down. Forward. Through.
**[CORE]** Two correct subsystems can compose into incorrect behavior. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation. (F-065, Axiom M2)
**[CORE]** The composer found more bugs in one real production usage session than 755 tests found in two movements. The gap between "tests pass" and "product works" is where quality lives.

## Learned Lessons
- **[Cycle 1, Forge]** Always check what exists before assuming you need to build.
- **[Cycle 1, Circuit]** Test the production path, not the internal method. `classify_execution()` had zero coverage while `classify()` was fully tested.
- **[Cycle 1, Harper]** Always check the error path, not just the happy path. Stale detection only covered COMPLETED, not FAILED.
- **[Cycle 1, Dash]** Don't assume something is broken without checking. The dashboard has 23 Python files, ~50 endpoints, all functional.
- **[Cycle 1, Composer Notes]** The learning store schema migration failure (#140) brought down ALL jobs. Always write migrations, tests, verify against existing DBs.
- **[Cycle 1, Lens]** 12 learning commands (36% of CLI) dominate help output — poor information architecture.
- **[Cycle 1, Warden]** stdout_tail/stderr_tail stored in 6+ locations without credential scanning. Safety applied piecemeal.
- **[Cycle 1, Blueprint]** SpecCorpusLoader used `if not name:` instead of `if name is None:` — rejects falsy-but-valid YAML values.
- **[Cycle 1, Ghost]** When the foundation is about to shift, audit first. The instinct to "do something" is wrong when you don't know the baseline.
- **[Cycle 1, Breakpoint]** Test the abstraction level that runs in production. Zero tests existed for PriorityScheduler._detect_cycle().
- **[Movement 1, Axiom]** Failed sheets must propagate failure to dependents. Without propagation, `is_job_complete` returns False forever — zombie jobs.
- **[Movement 1, Theorem]** Property-based testing finds bugs hand-picked examples miss. Hypothesis found the escalation terminal-guard violation in seconds.
- **[Movement 1, Adversary]** Every handler that transitions sheet status must check `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. The baton's guard pattern is now complete.
- **[Movement 1, Mateship]** The finding→fix pipeline works without coordination: F-018 filed by Bedrock, proved by Breakpoint, fixed by Axiom, verified by Journey. Four musicians, zero meetings.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** `record_attempt()` correctly doesn't count successes; `_handle_attempt_result` correctly retries on 0% validation. Together: infinite loop. Bugs at system boundaries.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** The pause model (`job.paused` boolean) serves three masters: user, escalation, cost. Post-v1: replace with pause reason set.
- **[Movement 2, Newcomer]** The gap between "feature works" and "feature is taught" is where adoption dies. F-083 — instrument system had zero adoption in examples.

## Design Decisions
- **Baton migration:** Feature-flagged BatonAdapter. Old and new paths coexist. Do not re-debate.
- **Cost visibility:** Scoped first (CostTracker in status), full UX later.
- **Learning schema changes:** Additive only without escalation.
- **Code-mode techniques:** Long-term direction. MCP supported for v1. code_mode flag exists, not wired.
- **No automatic instrument fallback on rate limits.** Explicit opt-in only.
- **Daemon-only architecture.** All state in ~/.mozart/mozart-state.db. JsonStateBackend deprecated.
- **Musician-baton contract:** validation_pass_rate defaults to 0.0 (safety), baton auto-corrects to 100.0 when validations_total==0 and execution_success==True.
- **Terminal state invariant:** All baton handlers guard against `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. Seven bugs found and fixed by three independent methodologies.
- **Pause model debt:** Single boolean serving three masters. Post-v1 → pause_reasons set.

## Current Status

Movement 2 — IN PROGRESS.

### Movement 2 Updates (Maverick + Canyon)
- **STEP 29 RESOLVED** (Maverick b4146a7, mateship pickup): Restart recovery committed. recover_job(), state sync callback, orphan recovery on start(), _resume_via_baton(). 27 TDD tests. 8th uncommitted work pickup.
- **F-132 PARTIALLY RESOLVED** (Maverick b4146a7): Fixed process.py but MISSED clone.py. Canyon found the same bug in `build_clone_config()` — DRY violation, two paths building clone configs both missed state_db_path. Canyon's fix: clone.py:144 + 3 TDD tests. Now fully resolved.
- **M2 Baton is now COMPLETE** — all steps 17-29 done. Ready for `use_baton: true` testing.
- **Canyon co-composer review**: Step 29 wiring verified on HEAD. _resume_via_baton() loads checkpoint → builds sheets → recover_job(). _recover_baton_orphans() loads paused checkpoints at startup. state_sync_callback wired to adapter constructor. Manager duplicates of _on_baton_state_sync and _recover_baton_orphans removed (were added by Canyon before discovering the existing implementations).

- **F-134 FOUND + RESOLVED** (Foundation M2): `_run_via_baton()` used non-existent `config.cost_limits.max_cost_usd` — should be `max_cost_per_job`. Latent bug that would silently disable cost limits when `use_baton` is enabled. Fixed in both `_run_via_baton()` and `_resume_via_baton()`.

### Movement 2 Updates (Harper)
- **F-122 RESOLVED** (Harper bd72395): All 5 DaemonClient callsites that bypassed --conductor-clone now use `_resolve_socket_path(None)`. Hooks (concert chaining), MCP tools, dashboard routes, job_control, and app factory. 14 TDD tests. Zero hardcoded socket bypasses remain in codebase.
- **F-131 RESOLVED** (Harper bd72395): --conductor-clone help text updated to require = syntax.
- **F-111 + F-113 + F-119 MATESHIP PICKUP** (Harper 861ef63): P0 production fixes committed from working tree. F-111: exception objects preserved in ParallelBatchResult, lifecycle re-raises RateLimitExhaustedError (PAUSE not FAIL). F-113: failed sheet failure propagated to dependents. F-119: baton event stubs now log instead of silently dropping.
- **Conductor-clone is now FULLY COMPLETE** — zero socket path bypasses remain. All IPC paths are clone-aware.

### Movement 2 Updates (Circuit — Verification Sweep)
- **FINDINGS.md cleanup:** Updated 7 findings from Open → Resolved with detailed resolutions: F-111 (P0), F-113 (P0), F-116 (P2), F-122 (P1), F-127 (P2), F-129 (P1), F-131 (P3). All verified against committed code on HEAD.
- **P0 production bugs RESOLVED:** F-111 (rate limit type lost in parallel) and F-113 (failed deps treated as done) — both fixed by unnamed musician, committed by Harper (861ef63), verified by Circuit. The two highest-severity open bugs are now closed.
- **F-129 (restart deadlock) RESOLVED:** Fixed as a side effect of F-113 — FAILED status now in the terminal set, so DAG resolution works from persisted state without needing the ephemeral `_permanently_failed` set.
- **Quality gate:** 10,132 tests pass, mypy clean, ruff clean. Zero failures.
- **System observation:** The mateship pipeline has matured to the point where fix→commit→verify happens across multiple musicians without explicit coordination. The finding→fix→verify chain is the orchestra's strongest institutional mechanism.

### Movement 2 Updates (Blueprint)
- **F-116 RESOLVED** (Blueprint 327e536): V210 InstrumentNameCheck — validates instrument names against loaded profiles at `mozart validate` time. Checks score-level, per-sheet, instrument_map, and movement instruments. WARNING severity. 15 TDD tests.
- **F-127 RESOLVED** (Blueprint 327e536): `_classify_success_outcome()` now uses persisted `SheetState.attempt_count` instead of session-local `normal_attempts`. Sheets with 18 cumulative attempts after restart correctly show SUCCESS_RETRY, not SUCCESS_FIRST_TRY. 7 TDD tests.
- **F-132 clone isolation tests** (Blueprint 327e536): 5 additional tests verifying state_db_path and log_file isolation in build_clone_config.

### Reviews Summary (M1C7)
- **Prism:** 42 commits verified. Closed 4 GitHub issues (#104, #149, #150, #151). F-104 verified complete. THREE GAPS UNCHANGED: step 29, F-009, demo.
- **Ember:** Golden path solid. Persistent paper cuts: F-127 (diagnose lies), F-048/F-108 ($0.00 cost), F-067b (init positional arg), F-116 (invalid instrument passes validation).
- **Axiom:** Baton spec compliance 3/4 invariants hold. Lovable/Wordware demos at zero — 5 movements non-compliance. Baton-runner divergence accelerating.
- **North:** Issued D-014–D-019. Directives with named musicians work; without don't. Step 29 stalled 5+ movements.
- **Tempo:** Build→Converge→Verify three-cycle rhythm emerged naturally. Uncommitted work anti-pattern RESOLVING.
- **Weaver:** ALL 6 M1C1 integration seams RESOLVED. Step 29 sole remaining. Organizational geometry (32 parallel, 1 serial) fights the need.

### Key Deliverables (Movement 1 — All Cycles)
- **F-104 RESOLVED** (Forge 3deb436): Full 5-layer prompt rendering in baton musician. BATON EXECUTION UNBLOCKED.
- **--conductor-clone RESOLVED** (Spark+Ghost+Harper): Global CLI option, socket/PID/config isolation, named clones, 58+ TDD tests.
- **F-118 RESOLVED** (Axiom 4520d05): ValidationEngine context gap fixed — full template_variables() in baton _validate().
- **Error taxonomy** (Blueprint): E006 stale detection, Phase 4.5 rate limit override, crash/stale patterns in CliErrorConfig.
- **F-025 RESOLVED** (Warden): Credential env filtering via required_env field on CliCommand. 19 TDD tests.
- **Production bugs RESOLVED**: F-075 (resume corruption), F-076 (validation ordering), F-077 (hooks lost on restart). All via mateship (Maverick f58fc89).
- **M4 data models** (Blueprint 75bebed): InstrumentDef, MovementDef, per_sheet_instruments, instrument_map, movements on JobConfig.
- **Documentation** (Codex+Guide): spec corpus + grounding hooks in score-writing-guide, 4 missing CLI commands, instrument_name template var, Rosetta proof scores in README.
- **Testing**: 215 adversarial (Breakpoint+Adversary), 136 property-based (Theorem), 36 litmus (Litmus), 44 edge case journeys (Journey). Zero new bugs in M4 code.
- **Security** (Sentinel): Full audit, zero new findings. All 4 shell paths protected. F-061 (CVEs) blocks public release.

### Movement 2 Updates (Forge, Cycle 2)
- **F-111 RESOLVED** (Forge, committed by Harper 861ef63): Parallel executor now preserves `RateLimitExhaustedError` in `ParallelBatchResult.exceptions`. Lifecycle re-raises original exception → job PAUSES, not FAILS. 8 TDD tests.
- **F-113 RESOLVED** (Forge, committed by Harper 861ef63): `propagate_failure_to_dependents()` added to `ParallelExecutor` — BFS through DAG marks dependents as FAILED. `get_next_parallel_batch` includes FAILED in terminal set (survives restarts). 6 TDD tests.
- **F-119 RESOLVED** (Forge, committed by Harper 861ef63): Baton event stubs log instead of silent `pass`.
- **F-112 DEFERRED**: Auto-resume after rate limit pause. Needs manager.py + registry changes. Baton timer wheel is better vehicle.

### Movement 2 Updates (Codex)
- **M4 Step 44 Documentation: instrument migration guide COMPLETE** — Added backend→instrument migration section to score-writing-guide.md with field mapping table, before/after YAML, and compatibility notes. This closes the last remaining documentation gap from the M4 roadmap.
- **CLI reference V-code verification** — All 25 V-codes verified against source code. V009 fixed from WARNING to ERROR (matched `ValidationSeverity.ERROR` in `config.py:290`). Stale `--workspace` example removed from pause command.
- **Limitations.md updated** — Baton execution engine section replaces "Phase 3 Components Not Wired". Instrument plugin system section replaces "Claude-Centric Design".
- **Mateship pickup** — Committed unnamed musician's CLI reference expansion (V-code tables, init positional arg, list --json) and daemon guide baton section after verifying all changes against source code.
- **Stale reference fix** — `score-writing-guide.md:1976` had `mozart status my-job -w ./workspace --watch` using hidden debug flag in user-facing example. Fixed to `--watch` only.

### Movement 2 Updates (Spark)
- **Mateship pickup — 3 commits, 17 files** (3269eb2, d242046, d149993):
  - F-065b RESOLVED: diagnose progress+timeline use format_sheet_display_status (6 TDD tests)
  - F-067b RESOLVED: init accepts positional argument like `git init my-project` (7 TDD tests)
  - run.py hint= → hints= fix (invisible terminal hint, 3 TDD tests)
  - Validation: movement/voice/voice_count/total_movements/instrument_name added to builtin sets
  - top.py: last 5 raw console.print migrated to output_error() — M3 step 35 FULLY COMPLETE
  - Examples: dialectic.yaml modernized (movements: key, movement/voice aliases, parallel)
  - Examples: 3 Rosetta proof scores moved from examples/ to examples/rosetta/
  - Rosetta corpus restructured (scores/rosetta-corpus.md)
- **FINDINGS.md:** F-065 (Ember) → Resolved. F-067 (Ember) → Resolved. F-047 → Resolved.

### Movement 2 Updates (Dash)
- **CLI UX Audit COMPLETE** (62fc205): Full audit at movement-2/cli-ux-audit.md. 6 issues (2 P1, 2 P2, 2 P3), overall grade B+. Top finding: 12 learning commands (46% of CLI) dominate help output — needs E-002 escalation for `mozart learning` subcommand refactor.
- **Terminology fixes** (62fc205): top.py --job→--score, clear --job→--score, clear docstring "terminal scores"→"completed, failed, and cancelled scores", modify docstring clarified, resume "job state"→"score state".
- **Mateship pickup** (44b7f99): Committed 6 TDD tests for top.py error standardization (Spark d242046's implementation, test file left untracked).
- **Error standardization CONFIRMED COMPLETE**: M3 step 35 fully done — zero raw console.print error calls remain. All remaining [red] usage is data coloring, not error output.

### Movement 2 Updates (Lens)
- **Hintless output_error() sweep** (089cc0c): Added hints to 5 output_error() calls that lacked constructive guidance. resume.py (3 paths: config load, config reload, fatal error), diagnose.py (2 paths: log read, log follow). 3 TDD tests in test_resume_error_hints.py. Core workflow error messages now all have actionable next steps.
- **Prior work committed via mateship**: F-065b, F-067b, hint=/hints= fix, validation variables, top.py error standardization — all picked up by Spark (3269eb2) and Dash (44b7f99) before this session. 10th occurrence of the uncommitted work pattern.

## Coordination Notes (Active)
- **CRITICAL PATH (UPDATED):** ~~Step 29~~ DONE → ~~F-111/F-113~~ DONE → Enable use_baton (--conductor-clone testing) → F-112 (auto-resume) → Demo.
- **D-005 ROOT CAUSE (Oracle):** F-009 is feedback loop disconnection — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching. STILL UNIMPLEMENTED after 5+ movements.
- **Uncommitted work:** Workspace files only. Mateship pipeline resolved the pattern.
- **F-132:** FULLY RESOLVED (Maverick + Canyon). Both code paths fixed.
- **F-128 WRONG (Adversary M1C7):** E006 IS reachable via classify_execution() — original analysis was incorrect.
- **GitHub issues closed (Ghost M2):** #95 (workspace path), #112 (health check quota), #99 (hooks restart). All verified.
- **M5 Hardening verified (Ghost M2):** Steps 45 + 46 complete. All 4 shell execution paths hardened.

### Movement 2 Updates (Oracle)
- **Codebase metrics:** 96,435 source lines (+0.8%), 10,159 tests (+1.1%), 101 models. Lowest growth movement = hardening phase.
- **Baton:** 5,265 lines (+4.5%), 969 tests (+21.9%). Step 29 committed. Highest test growth area.
- **Learning store (F-009):** 28,772 patterns, 88.6% never applied, validated tier grew 40% (130→182). Instrument tags: 3 of 28,772. STILL UNIMPLEMENTED.
- **V3 orchestra:** 58/706 complete (8.2%). M0+M1 done. M2 work started — 4 of 32 sheets dispatched.
- **Rate limit surge (F-099):** M2 setup sheets 55-58 required 6-18 retries. 51 unnecessary API calls. Same pattern as M1.
- **F-127 confirmed in production:** All 58 sheets show success_first_try despite 23 requiring 2-29 attempts.
- **p99 duration:** 30.5 minutes (n=27,910) — exactly at stale detection ceiling. Confirmed across all executions.
- **Flowspec:** 16,833 entities, 2,010 warnings, 0 critical. Warning-to-entity ratio improved to 11.9%.
- **Quality gates:** mypy clean, ruff clean, flowspec clean.
- **Uncommitted work:** 8 files — all workspace memory. No code. Anti-pattern resolving.
- **Predictive model:** 3-4 movements to demo-ready. 42-55 wall-clock hours to M3 completion.

### Movement 2 Updates (Atlas — Strategic Assessment)
- **STATUS.md updated** to reflect: baton COMPLETE, conductor-clone COMPLETE, 10,100+ tests, 96,435 source lines. Critical blockers updated.
- **Strategic assessment:** The baton is the most verified untested system in the project — 1,000+ tests, 4 independent methodologies, never run a real sheet. The critical path is now activation only: enable use_baton → test → fix → demo.
- **F-009 upgraded to CRITICAL:** 6 movements without implementation. Product thesis unsubstantiated. The intelligence layer doesn't learn.
- **Organizational observation:** The orchestra self-selects for parallel building, not serial activation. Named musician assignments are required for convergence tasks.

### Movement 2 Updates (Warden)
- **F-135 FOUND + RESOLVED:** Musician exception handler at `musician.py:156` leaked credentials via `error_message`. Exception text was stored unredacted in SheetAttemptResult, logs, state DB, and diagnostic output — while stdout/stderr were correctly redacted 3 lines away. Applied `redact_credentials()` to both exception handler and validation error handler. 26 TDD tests.
- **F-061 RESOLVED:** Added minimum version pins for 3 CVE-affected transitive dependencies: `cryptography>=46.0.6`, `pyjwt>=2.12.0`, `requests>=2.33.0`. The last security finding blocking public release is now closed.
- **Safety posture:** All known credential leak paths are now protected. All shell execution paths are hardened. Dependency CVEs resolved. The only remaining open security findings are F-021 (sandbox bypass, acceptable for v1) and F-022 (CSP unsafe-inline, mitigated by LOCALHOST_ONLY).

### Movement 2 Updates (Sentinel — Security Review, Second Pass)
- **F-136 FOUND + RESOLVED:** `_classify_error()` at `musician.py:587-628` returned backend `error_message` without credential redaction. Third instance of the piecemeal redaction pattern (after F-003 stdout/stderr and F-135 exceptions). Fixed at musician.py:129. 5 TDD tests.
- **F-137 FILED (P3):** Pygments 2.19.2 has CVE-2026-4539 (ReDoS in ADL lexer). Fix: 2.20.0. Near-zero risk — ADL lexer unused by Mozart.
- **Full security audit results:** 12 subprocess spawn sites verified (zero unprotected). All 3 credential data paths through musician protected. F-061 CVEs confirmed resolved. Open security findings reduced to 3 (F-021, F-022, F-137), none critical. All acceptable for v1.

### Movement 2 Updates (Bedrock — Ground Verification)
- **Milestone table corrected:** All counts were stale. M0=22/22, M1=17/17, M2=23/23, M3=23/23, M4=8/17 (47% not 36%), M5=3/7 (43%), conductor-clone=17/18 (94%), composer-assigned=11/27 (41%). M5 and composer-assigned rows were missing.
- **Findings hygiene:** Updated 3 stale original entries (F-097, F-098, F-104) to point to their resolution entries. Resolved F-107b (composer's uncommitted fixes — verified committed on HEAD).
- **Quality gate:** pytest 10,180 passed (0 failed, exit 0). mypy clean. ruff clean. 96,443 source lines, 285 test files.
- **Working tree CLEAN:** 8 changes — all workspace memory + 2 score files. No uncommitted code. Anti-pattern resolved.
- **Finding ID collision flagged:** F-107 used twice (same class as F-070, F-086). 4 collision incidents total.

### Movement 2 Updates (Litmus — Effectiveness Validation)
- **20 new litmus tests** (6db727c): Categories 11-17 validating M2 completions. 56 total litmus tests.
- **Step 29 recovery VALIDATED:** recover_job() correctly preserves terminal states, resets in_progress→PENDING, carries forward attempt counts. The adapter kicks DispatchRetry after recovery so dispatch_ready runs immediately.
- **Completion signaling VALIDATED:** wait_for_completion() correctly detects all-success vs any-failure using asyncio.Event pattern.
- **F-134 VALIDATED:** Both _run_via_baton and _resume_via_baton access config.cost_limits.max_cost_per_job (not the old max_cost_usd). CostLimitConfig.model_fields confirms max_cost_usd doesn't exist.
- **F-135 VALIDATED:** musician.py imports and calls redact_credentials on raw_error_msg in the exception handler.
- **F-132 VALIDATED:** build_clone_config produces isolated state_db_path in both code paths (with and without base_config). Named clones get unique paths.
- **F-111/F-113 VALIDATED structurally:** ParallelBatchResult.exceptions preserves types, propagate_failure_to_dependents exists, SheetStatus.FAILED in terminal set.
- **State mapping totality VALIDATED:** Every CheckpointState status maps to baton status and vice versa — no unmapped states.

### Movement 2 Updates (Breakpoint — Adversarial Verification)
- **63 adversarial tests committed** in `tests/test_baton_m2c2_adversarial.py`: Fixed and extended untracked file (47→63 tests, 2 bugs fixed: missing `attempt` field, short credential key). 13 test classes covering step 29 recovery, state sync, credential redaction, rate limit extraction, failure propagation, cost limits, status mapping, completion signaling, instrument resolution.
- **No new bugs found** in M2 completion code. Step 29, F-111/F-113, F-135/F-136, F-134 — all correct under adversarial conditions.
- **Score-level instrument resolution verified:** 12 TDD tests in `test_score_level_instrument_resolution.py` all pass. Resolution at `sheet.py:249-255`, V210 recognizes at `config.py:517-518`.
- **Testing infrastructure risk identified:** Untracked test files written but never run create false confidence. Mateship pipeline should verify before committing.

## Top Risks
1. **F-009 (P0):** Learning store effectiveness inert 6+ movements. Root cause known. Intelligence thesis unproven. CRITICAL.
2. **Demo work (P0):** Neither Lovable nor Wordware demos started. Product invisible to the world.
3. ~~**F-111 (P0):**~~ RESOLVED. ~~**F-113 (P0):**~~ RESOLVED.
4. **Baton activation (HIGH):** All code complete. Never run a real sheet. Needs --conductor-clone testing.
5. **F-112 (P1):** Auto-resume after rate limit PAUSE not yet implemented. Jobs pause correctly but need manual resume.
5. **Enable use_baton:** Step 29 resolved, F-111/F-113 resolved, but use_baton not yet activated. Needs --conductor-clone testing.

## Blockers
- **F-009 (P1):** Learning store inert. Oracle found root cause (narrow tag matching). Still unimplemented.
- **F-104:** RESOLVED. **#145:** RESOLVED. **F-103:** RESOLVED. **Step 29:** RESOLVED.
- **#95:** RESOLVED (closed). **#112:** RESOLVED (closed). **#99:** RESOLVED (closed).

## Cold Archive

### Movement 1 (Cycles 1–7)
The orchestra's first full building movement. Thirty-two musicians worked in parallel with zero merge conflicts across 42 commits. The coordination substrate — TASKS.md, FINDINGS.md, collective memory — held under real load. Mateship was genuine and spontaneous: Harper picked up Ghost's doctor command, Journey rescued 5 untracked test files, Tempo committed PreflightConfig work, Prism committed 2,262 lines of stalled changes, Harper picked up 36 files in one mateship shot.

Three natural rhythms defined the movement: a build wave (Canyon, Ghost, Harper, Forge, Maverick, Blueprint, Foundation, Circuit creating infrastructure), a convergence wave (5 musicians self-organizing around the F-104 blocker without coordination), and a verification wave (Axiom, Theorem, Breakpoint, Adversary hardening the state machine through four independent testing methodologies — backward-tracing, property-based, adversarial, and experiential — each finding bugs the others missed). The instrument plugin system shipped end-to-end across 5 musicians in 8 coordinated steps.

The baton's terminal guard pattern was completed across all 19 status transitions through this convergence of methods. Seven bugs were found and fixed (F-039 through F-049). The credential scanner was wired at the single bottleneck (SheetState.capture_output) — architectural elegance over brute force.

The learning store remained the deepest systemic concern — 233K+ executions, 27K+ patterns, and the system cannot tell good from bad. Oracle's root cause analysis (91% of patterns never applied due to narrow tag matching) was the most important diagnosis. A trimodal distribution (0.50, 0.55, 0.98) with 3,111 differentiated patterns showed breadcrumbs of quality signal.

The uncommitted work anti-pattern peaked at 9 occurrences across all movements but was resolved by cycle 7 through Harper's mateship model. Working tree went from 36+ files to 12 (workspace files only).

The movement ended with all quality gates green, three major blockers resolved (F-104, conductor-clone, F-103), and a clear but unmoving critical path: Step 29 → use_baton → Demo. The orchestra builds infrastructure beautifully. The product gaps — step 29 unclaimed, F-009 unimplemented, demo at zero — are product gaps, not infrastructure gaps. The organizational geometry (32 parallel musicians, 1 serial critical path need) is the structural tension that defines the next movement.

### Earlier Movements (M0–M3 Build + M2 Review)
M0 stabilized the foundation: learning store remediation, critical bugs, dead code removal, intelligence verification. M1 shipped the instrument plugin system and sheet-first architecture. M2 built the baton core (event types, timer wheel, state model, dispatch, retry, rate limits, failure evaluation, BackendPool) plus the conductor-clone system. M3 delivered UX polish (status, doctor, init, instruments, error standardization), M4 data models, observability fixes, and production bug fixes. Canyon's step 28 wiring analysis (8 integration surfaces, 5-phase implementation) became the blueprint Foundation built from. The BatonAdapter (775+ lines, 64 TDD tests) wired 7 of 8 surfaces. The finding→fix pipeline matured into a reliable institutional mechanism. Newcomer's fresh-eyes audits drove real UX improvements. Guide's instrument migration (all 37 examples) closed the gap between feature availability and feature adoption.
