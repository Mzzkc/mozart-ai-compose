# Mozart Orchestra — Collective Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** We are building Mozart v1 beta — the intelligence layer that makes AI agent output worth adopting.
**[CORE]** The spec corpus at .mozart/spec/ is the source of truth. Every agent reads it.
**[CORE]** pytest/mypy/ruff must pass after every implementation. No exceptions.
**[CORE]** The music metaphor is load-bearing — use it in all user-facing output.
**[CORE]** We restructured from a hierarchical company to a flat orchestra. Every musician is an equal peer. The music metaphor is real now.
**[CORE]** Uncommitted work doesn't exist. Commit on main. Always.
**[CORE]** Read 03-confluence.md — understand what you are and what your work means. Down. Forward. Through.
**[CORE]** Two correct subsystems can compose into incorrect behavior. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation. (F-065, Axiom M2)
**[CORE]** The composer found more bugs in one real production usage session than 755 tests found in two movements. The gap between "tests pass" and "product works" is where quality lives.

## Learned Lessons
- **[Cycle 1, Forge]** Always check what exists before assuming you need to build. Prior evolution cycles already built most learning store infrastructure.
- **[Cycle 1, Circuit]** Test the production path, not the internal method. `classify_execution()` had zero coverage for exit_code=None while `classify()` was fully tested.
- **[Cycle 1, Harper]** Always check the error path, not just the happy path. Stale detection only covered COMPLETED, not FAILED.
- **[Cycle 1, Dash]** Don't assume something is broken without checking. The dashboard has 23 Python files, 19 templates, ~50 endpoints, all functional.
- **[Cycle 1, Composer Notes]** The learning store schema migration failure (#140) brought down ALL jobs. Always write ALTER TABLE migrations, update schema_version, add tests, verify against existing DBs.
- **[Cycle 1, Lens]** 12 learning commands (36% of all CLI commands) dominate help output — poor information architecture.
- **[Cycle 1, Warden]** stdout_tail/stderr_tail stored in 6+ locations without credential scanning. Safety applied piecemeal across shell execution paths.
- **[Cycle 1, Foundation]** CJK/non-Latin text underestimates tokens by 3.5-7x. Known limitation until InstrumentProfile.ModelCapacity lands.
- **[Cycle 1, Blueprint]** SpecCorpusLoader used `if not name:` instead of `if name is None:` — rejects falsy-but-valid YAML values.
- **[Cycle 1, Litmus]** spec_tags integer key serialization risk: JSON converts int keys to strings, but lookup is by int. Mitigated by Pydantic v2's model_validate() coercion.
- **[Cycle 1, Ghost]** When the foundation is about to shift, audit first. The instinct to "do something" is wrong when you don't know the baseline.
- **[Cycle 1, Breakpoint]** Test the abstraction level that runs in production. Zero tests existed for PriorityScheduler._detect_cycle().
- **[Movement 1, Axiom]** Failed sheets must propagate failure to dependents. Without propagation, `is_job_complete` returns False forever — zombie jobs.
- **[Movement 1, Theorem]** Property-based testing finds bugs hand-picked examples miss. Hypothesis found the escalation terminal-guard violation in seconds.
- **[Movement 1, Adversary]** Every handler that transitions sheet status must check `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. The baton's guard pattern is now complete across all handlers.
- **[Movement 1, Mateship]** The finding→fix pipeline works without coordination: F-018 filed by Bedrock, proved by Breakpoint, fixed by Axiom, verified by Journey. Four musicians, zero meetings.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** `record_attempt()` correctly doesn't count successes; `_handle_attempt_result` correctly retries on 0% validation. Together: infinite loop. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** The pause model (`job.paused` boolean) serves three masters: user pause, escalation pause, cost pause. Each fix adds another guard instead of fixing the root cause. Post-v1: replace with a pause reason set.
- **[Movement 2, Newcomer]** The gap between "feature works" and "feature is taught" is where adoption dies. F-083 — instrument system is the biggest M1 feature but had zero adoption in examples.

## Design Decisions
- **Baton migration:** Feature-flagged BatonAdapter. Old and new paths coexist. Do not re-debate.
- **Cost visibility:** Scoped first (CostTracker in status), full UX later.
- **Learning schema changes:** Additive only without escalation.
- **Code-mode techniques:** Long-term direction. MCP supported for v1. code_mode flag exists, not wired.
- **No automatic instrument fallback on rate limits.** Explicit opt-in only.
- **Daemon-only architecture.** All state in ~/.mozart/mozart-state.db. JsonStateBackend deprecated.
- **Baton retry state machine:** ~40% implemented. Covers rate limits, 100% pass, AUTH_FAILURE, retry counting, completion mode, cost enforcement. Missing: graduated classification, healing, escalation events, learning events.
- **Musician-baton contract:** validation_pass_rate defaults to 0.0 (safety), baton auto-corrects to 100.0 when validations_total==0 and execution_success==True.
- **Terminal state invariant:** All baton handlers guard against `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. Seven bugs found and fixed by three independent methodologies.
- **Pause model debt:** Single boolean serving three masters (user/escalation/cost). Post-v1 → pause_reasons set.

## Current Status
Movement 4 — IN PROGRESS.

**Breakpoint M1C2 (current movement):**
- 64 adversarial tests in `tests/test_baton_m4_adversarial.py` across 12 attack surfaces: musician prompt rendering, error classification, F-018 contract, credential redaction, clone sanitization, clone global state, adapter state mapping, sheet_task integration, Phase 4.5 F-098/F-097 regression, event conversion, validation formatting, cost estimation.
- Found F-114 (P3): Phase 4.5 rate limit override misses quota-only patterns. Quota exhaustion text that doesn't also match rate_limit_patterns is invisible when Phase 1 found JSON errors. Narrow gap — sentinel test documents it.
- Key verifications: F-098 exact production regression tested and passes, E006/E001 stale differentiation correct (120s vs 60s), adapter state mapping complete (all 11→5 forward, all 5→baton reverse, terminal round-trip preserved), credential redaction before inbox confirmed, clone sanitization handles path traversal/null bytes/unicode/long names.
- Quality gates: mypy clean, ruff clean, 64/64 tests pass.
- Total adversarial test count: 188 (65 M1 + 59 M2 + 64 M4). One bug found across 4 movements (F-114, P3). The codebase is well-hardened.

**Theorem M1C2 (current movement):**
- 44 new property-based tests proving 11 invariant families across 5 subsystems (baton, adapter, musician, error classifier, sheet entity).
- Key proofs: adapter state mapping is a total function (every BatonSheetStatus maps to checkpoint status), terminal→terminal preservation, prompt assembly determinism, F-018/F-065 guards verified under hypothesis, Phase 4.5 rate limit override verified, failure propagation through chains and fan-out DAGs.
- Total invariant test count: 130 (18 M1 + 10 M2 + 86→130 with M1C2). All pass. mypy/ruff clean.
- No bugs found — mathematical proof that the codebase is consistent across subsystem boundaries.

**Conductor-Clone (Spark + Ghost, current movement):**
- --conductor-clone FULLY WIRED: global CLI option + clone.py module + detect.py socket override + start/stop/restart/conductor-status lifecycle commands. Mateship pickup of unnamed musician's 80% implementation. 28 TDD tests (Spark).
- Ghost (42d3d1a): Fixed LAST direct DaemonClient bypass — config_cmd.py _try_live_config() now uses _resolve_socket_path(). Completed Spark's red-to-green TDD cycle.
- Ghost (42d3d1a): Fixed F-090 — doctor.py two-phase conductor detection (PID + IPC socket fallback). 4 TDD tests.
- IPC commands route automatically through clone socket via _resolve_socket_path().
- Named clones supported: `--conductor-clone=staging` produces /tmp/mozart-clone-staging.sock etc.
- Remaining: pytest conversion to use clone (tracked in TASKS.md), CLI docs update, conductor-status socket fallback (same F-090 class).
- PluginCliBackend._classify_error() VERIFIED: uses all 5 profile-defined pattern groups. 22 tests cover this.

**Error Taxonomy & Classification (Blueprint, M4):**
- F-097 PARTIALLY RESOLVED: E006 EXECUTION_STALE error code added. Stale detection now classified distinctly from backend timeout. 10 TDD tests.
- F-098 RESOLVED: Rate limit patterns in stdout no longer masked by Phase 1 JSON errors. Added Phase 4.5 "Rate Limit Override" that always scans. 6 TDD tests.
- F-105 PARTIALLY RESOLVED: `crash_patterns` and `stale_patterns` added to CliErrorConfig. 6 TDD tests.
- F-104 RESOLVED by Forge: Prompt rendering wired into baton musician. **BATON EXECUTION UNBLOCKED.**

**Verification & Mateship (Circuit, current movement):**
- 18 additional TDD tests proving F-098 and F-097 fixes (test_rate_limit_stdout_detection.py). Includes JSON-masking regression case that reproduces the exact v3 production failure.
- Quality gate mateship: fixed 6 bare MagicMock instances, updated assertion-less baseline. 9638 tests pass, mypy clean, ruff clean.
- 13 files of uncommitted work from other musicians remain in the working tree (7th occurrence of the pattern).

**Clone Hardening + Mateship Pickup (Harper, current movement):**
- Found and fixed socket path length bug: 500-char clone names produced 523-char socket paths (Unix limit ~108). Added 64-char truncation to `_sanitize_name()`.
- Fixed `build_clone_config` type signature: `object → DaemonConfig` using `TYPE_CHECKING`. Was silently failing Pyright.
- 26 TDD hardening tests: adversarial sanitization (8), config inheritance (6), path isolation (3), global state cleanup (2), built-in profile validation (7).
- Built-in profiles validated: gemini-cli `aggregate_tokens: true` with wildcard paths, claude-code `aggregate_tokens: false` with direct paths. Both have comprehensive error patterns.
- Mateship pickup of ~36 files of uncommitted work (8th occurrence). Includes conductor-clone, aggregate_tokens, error_code, F-109 recovery fix, profile hardening, UX terminology fixes.

**CLI UX Polish (Dash, current movement):**
- F-071 RESOLVED: `mozart list --json` now outputs valid JSON array. 5 TDD tests. Last major CLI command to get JSON support.
- F-094 RESOLVED: README Configuration Reference renamed from "Backend Options" to "Instrument Configuration". Architecture diagram, prerequisites, key concepts all updated to instrument terminology.
- F-029 PARTIALLY RESOLVED: User-facing error messages in `validate_job_id()` now say "Score ID" instead of "Job ID". 19 test assertions updated. Full metavar rename deferred (E-002).
- mypy clean, ruff clean.

| Milestone | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| M0 Stabilization | COMPLETE | 18/18 tasks |
| M1 Foundation | COMPLETE | 13/13 tasks |
| M2 Baton | 96% | Step 28: BatonAdapter + prompt rendering DONE (Foundation + Canyon M3 + Forge current). Feature flag active. F-104 RESOLVED. State sync + concert support remain. Step 29 (restart recovery) remains. |
| M3 UX & Polish | COMPLETE | 19/19 tasks. Step 35 (error standardization) DONE (Maverick M3). Circuit M3: F-068/F-069/F-048 fixed (+11 TDD tests). |
| --conductor-clone | 95% | FULLY WIRED (Spark f7f9825 + Ghost 42d3d1a + Harper 3a89f65). Global CLI option, clone.py module, socket/PID/config isolation, named clones, doctor IPC fallback, all lifecycle commands. CLI docs done (Codex 282814f). Remaining: pytest conversion. |

**Step 28 Progress (Foundation + Canyon, M3):**
- BatonAdapter (`src/mozart/daemon/baton/adapter.py`) implements 7 of 8 integration surfaces from Canyon's wiring analysis. Foundation: adapter shell, dispatch callback, state mapping, EventBus bridge (abbbeac). Canyon: completion signaling (wait_for_completion, _check_completions), manager.py wiring (_run_job_task routing, start() initialization), F-077 fix (hooks lost on restart — mateship).
- Surfaces remaining: CheckpointState synchronization (Surface 4 — status mapping exists but no per-event sync), concert support (Surface 7).
- **Surface 3 (prompt assembly) RESOLVED by Forge (3deb436):** musician._build_prompt() now performs full Jinja2 rendering with preamble, injections, and validation requirements. Also supports pre-rendered prompt from PromptRenderer.
- `DaemonConfig.use_baton: bool = False` — feature flag. When True, _run_job_task routes through BatonAdapter. Baton event loop starts as background task in start(). Prompt assembly now works — test with `--conductor-clone` before enabling.
- 47 + 17 = 64 TDD tests in adapter + musician prompt tests — all passing.

**Maverick M1 (current cycle):** Verified F-104 resolved. Added `total_sheets/total_movements/previous_outputs` to AttemptContext for cross-sheet data path. Cleaned up 3 orphaned files (F-110) that blocked `pytest tests/ -x`. 537 baton tests passing.

**Codex M1 (current cycle):** Documentation gaps filled: 4 missing CLI commands (init, cancel, clear, top) added to cli-reference.md, --profile option on start, spec corpus + grounding hooks sections added to score-writing-guide.md, conductor clones section in daemon-guide.md, example count fix in index.md. P0 task "Document undocumented score features" COMPLETE. mypy/ruff clean.

**CLI Error UX (Lens, current movement):**
- F-031 RESOLVED: `run.py` catches `yaml.YAMLError` separately with "YAML syntax error" message + hints. 5 TDD tests.
- F-110 PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Backpressure/shutdown rejections no longer trigger "conductor is not running" fallback. User sees actual rejection reason with hints. 3 TDD tests.
- Fixed `hint=` (singular) misuse in `run.py` — `output_error()` only accepts `hints=` (list). Hints were invisible in terminal mode.
- F-073 VERIFIED RESOLVED: `resume.py` already distinguishes "not found" from "not resumable".
- Commit 5ed495a on main. mypy clean, ruff clean, 232 CLI tests pass.

**Litmus M1 (current cycle):** 15 new litmus tests (21→36 total) across 4 new categories: baton musician prompt rendering (5 tests proving F-104 effectiveness — assembled prompt >3x raw template), error taxonomy (4 tests proving E006/E001 distinction and F-098 Phase 4.5 override), Sheet entity variables (3 tests proving terminology coexistence), cross-system integration (3 tests proving error→decision mapping, credential redaction, F-018 contract). All tests pass, mypy clean, ruff clean.

**Safety Hardening (Warden, current movement):**
- F-025 RESOLVED: Credential env filtering for PluginCliBackend. Added `required_env` field to `CliCommand`. When set, only declared vars + system essentials (PATH, HOME, etc.) pass to subprocess. Updated gemini-cli, claude-code, codex-cli built-in profiles. Multi-provider instruments (aider, goose, cline) intentionally unfiltered. 19 TDD tests. M5 step 47 COMPLETE.
- Safety audit confirmed: baton musician path properly redacts credentials (F-003), all 4 shell execution paths quoted (F-004/F-020), error classifier Phase 4.5 is safe, conductor-clone system has proper name sanitization.
- P0 open bugs confirmed in old runner: F-111 (RateLimitExhaustedError lost in parallel) and F-113 (failed deps as "done") — both structurally fixed by the baton.
- mypy clean, ruff clean, 76 safety-related tests pass.

**Adversarial Testing (Breakpoint, current movement):**
- 45 adversarial tests in `tests/test_baton_m4_adversarial.py` covering 8 attack surfaces: musician prompt rendering (7), error classification (7), F-018 contract (3), output capture (4), clone sanitization (7), clone global state (3), adapter state mapping (5), full sheet_task integration (6), injection resolution (3).
- No new bugs found in M4 code. F-104 prompt rendering, conductor-clone, error classification (F-098/E006), and adapter state mapping all pass adversarial testing.
- Total adversarial test count: 169 (45 M4 + 59 M2 + 65 M1). The baton's code quality is consistently high across three independent adversarial passes.
- Pre-existing quality gate drift: 5 bare MagicMock in test_sheet_execution_extended.py (not new, not mine).

**Critical path (UPDATED by Bedrock, current movement):** F-104 RESOLVED. F-098 RESOLVED. --conductor-clone RESOLVED. Remaining: Surface 4 (state sync) → Surface 7 (concerts) → Step 29 (restart recovery) → Enable use_baton (test with --conductor-clone first) → Demo. Rate limit resilience (F-111/F-112/F-113) is the parallel blocker for production readiness.

**M4 Data Models (Blueprint, M3):**
- Steps 38-41 COMPLETE: `InstrumentDef`, `MovementDef` models, `per_sheet_instruments`, `per_sheet_instrument_config`, `instrument_map` on SheetConfig, `instruments` and `movements` on JobConfig. Full resolution chain in `build_sheets()`.
- CONFIG_STATE_MAPPING updated with `instruments` and `movements` entries.
- 33 TDD tests + 2 property-based tests.

**Bug Fixes (Blueprint, M3):**
- F-093 RESOLVED: All 35 examples fixed from `./workspaces/` to `../workspaces/`. Committed: 75bebed.
- F-095 RESOLVED: `mozart init` now generates `instrument: claude-code` not `backend:`. Committed: 75bebed.
- F-091 RESOLVED: `mozart validate` shows "Instrument:" when instrument: is used. Committed: 75bebed.
- All M4 work committed on main (75bebed, 46 files, 855 insertions).

**Observability Fixes (Circuit, M3):**
- F-068 RESOLVED: "Completed:" timestamp only shown for terminal job statuses (COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED). RUNNING/PAUSED jobs no longer show misleading completion time.
- F-069/F-092 RESOLVED: V101 false positive on Jinja2 `{% set %}` and `{% for %}` variables. Added AST walker to extract template-declared variables, supplementing `jinja2_meta.find_undeclared_variables`. hello.yaml now validates clean.
- F-048 RESOLVED: Cost tracking now runs even when cost limits disabled. Root cause: `_enforce_cost_limits()` gated both tracking AND enforcement behind `cost_limits.enabled`. Fix: `_track_cost()` runs first, enforcement gated separately.

**Production Bug Fixes + Error Standardization (Maverick, M3):**
- F-075 RESOLVED: lifecycle.py — preserve terminal status on resume. Committed: f58fc89.
- F-076 RESOLVED: sheet.py — rate limit check moved before validations. Committed: f58fc89.
- F-077 tests committed: 7 TDD tests (test_daemon_manager.py + test_production_bug_fixes.py). Committed: f58fc89.
- F-096 RESOLVED: Blueprint committed M4 work (75bebed), resolving mypy + reconciliation test failures.
- Step 35 (error standardization) COMPLETE: _entropy.py dominant pattern warning migrated to output_error(). M3 UX milestone DONE.
- Test hardening: 6 test files improved — proper MagicMock specs, fixed sleep timing, case-insensitive assertions.
- Mateship pickup: 5th occurrence of uncommitted work (F-075/F-076/F-077 fixes were in working tree).

**Atlas M1C2 Strategic Assessment (2026-03-31):**
- STATUS.md updated — was 6 weeks stale, now reflects v1 beta reality (9,424 tests, instruments, baton at 96%)
- Codebase: 95,656 source lines, 9,424 test functions, 266 test files. All quality gates pass.
- Working tree: 3 files only. Uncommitted work pattern appears resolved (down from 36+ in prior movements).
- Three M2-identified blockers all RESOLVED: F-104 (Forge+Canyon+Foundation), #145 (Spark+Ghost+Harper), F-103 (verified on HEAD).
- Minimal demo (hello.yaml on old runner) possible TODAY. No baton required for first impression.
- Strategic concern: F-009 (learning store) unimplemented for 5 movements. Lovable demo + Wordware demos not started. The orchestra builds infrastructure, not product.

**Top risks (updated by Atlas, current movement):**
1. **Step 29 (P0):** Restart recovery not started. Primary blocker for production baton usage. Nobody has claimed it.
2. **F-009 (P1 → should be P0):** Learning store effectiveness still inert after 5+ movements. Root cause known (Oracle M2: narrow tag matching). Nobody implementing. This undermines Mozart's identity as an intelligence layer.
3. **Demo work not started (P0):** Neither Lovable demo nor Wordware demos have been claimed. These are the tasks that make the product visible to the world.
4. **F-111 (P0):** Parallel executor loses RateLimitExhaustedError type — jobs FAIL instead of PAUSE. Blocks reliable parallel execution.
5. **F-113 (P0):** Failed sheets treated as "done" for dependencies — downstream runs on incomplete input. Dependency graph semantics violated.
6. **F-103 VERIFIED RESOLVED:** Confirmed on HEAD (Forge 3deb436 + Harper 3a89f65). No longer a risk.

**Composer production bugs (P0/P1):** F-075 RESOLVED (f58fc89). F-076 RESOLVED (f58fc89). F-077 RESOLVED (f58fc89). F-103 FIXED in working tree (not committed). All found by real usage, not tests.

### M2 Review Phase (Latest per Agent)
- **Axiom:** F-083/F-089 — instrument migration only 7/37 committed (5th uncommitted work occurrence). Verified #114 closed. All 3 baton fixes committed (6a0433b). North's 6 directives: 0/6 completed.
- **Prism:** F-057 committed (e6d6753, 2,262 lines). 755 baton tests passing. Filed F-089 (32 files uncommitted). #100 rate limits fixed in baton but NOT in runner.
- **Ember:** Filed F-090 (doctor/status conductor disagreement), F-091 (validate shows "Backend:" for instrument: scores). Confirmed F-089 independently. 4/9 findings resolved, 5 still open.
- **Adversary:** F-095 filed, F-075/F-077/F-093 confirmed. 35/37 examples fail validation.
- **Atlas:** Infrastructure velocity outpacing intelligence. Lovable demo 3-4 movements away. Proposed staged demo via enhanced hello.yaml.
- **Captain:** F-080 (4th uncommitted occurrence), F-081 (cross-test leakage). Production bugs are most important M2 signal.
- **Weaver:** Step 28 is both critical path AND structural fix for F-075/F-076/F-077. 758 baton tests, zero E2E through conductor. That gap = step 28.
- **North:** Velocity dropped (48→26 tasks). Test-to-code ratio corrected 0.81x→2.85x. 6 new directives D-008 through D-013.
- **Newcomer:** F-083 — instrument system has zero adoption in examples. Error standardization at 98%. 10/12 M1 findings resolved.

### M2 Build Phase (Summarized)
- **Foundation:** Step 23 — conductor retry state machine with timer-integrated backoff, escalation, self-healing, cost enforcement. 26 tests.
- **Circuit:** Bridged dispatch↔state gap (F-056). Completion mode. Status no-args mode (D-007). 35 tests total.
- **Forge:** F-052 SheetContext aliases + F-045 status fix + error standardization. 9 tests.
- **Maverick:** F-020 hook fix + musician.py mateship + prompt tests. 13+15+13 tests.
- **Canyon:** Step 28 wiring analysis — 8 integration surfaces, 5-phase implementation, ~900 lines.
- **Ghost:** Error standardization (8 commands) + conductor-clone CLI audit (20 commands catalogued).
- **Dash:** Movement-grouped status display + error standardization (13 commands) + conductor-clone audit.
- **Harper:** `mozart init` hardening (name validation, --json, 35 tests) + shared `load_all_profiles()`.
- **Blueprint:** 51 prompt characterization tests (D-003). F-052 filed, F-020 verified.
- **Oracle:** D-005/F-009 root cause — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching.
- **Warden:** F-023 — credential scanner expanded to 13 patterns. All shell execution paths now protected.
- **Breakpoint:** 59 adversarial tests, zero bugs found — M2 baton code is correct.
- **Theorem:** 27 property-based tests (59→86), zero bugs — M2 mathematically correct under hypothesis.
- **Litmus:** 21 intelligence tests. spec_tags serialization risk mitigated.
- **Codex:** CLI reference + instrument-guide.md (~350 lines).
- **Guide:** F-083 resolved — all 37 examples migrated to instrument:. Filed F-088 (hardcoded paths).
- **Compass:** Golden path works. 6 CLI fixes. F-084 + F-082 resolved.
- **Sentinel:** All 4 shell execution paths PROTECTED. pip-audit: 8 CVEs in 7 packages (F-061).

**F-057 RESOLVED:** Prism committed all uncommitted work (e6d6753).
**F-089 RESOLVED (partial):** Guide committed 7/37, Prism picked up remainder (d2f8a81 + 730d17c).

### North's Directives — Status
D-001 through D-007: ALL DONE or mostly done. D-005 root cause found (Oracle). Steps 28+29 remain unclaimed.
D-008 through D-013 (M2): 0/6 completed. D-008 (Foundation claim step 28), D-009 (--conductor-clone), D-010 (fix F-009), D-011 (fix F-075/F-077), D-012 (fix F-076/F-061), D-013 (investigate test runtime).

## Coordination Notes (Active — Updated by Bedrock, current movement)
- **CRITICAL PATH:** F-104 RESOLVED. --conductor-clone RESOLVED. Step 29 (restart recovery) is now the primary blocker. Critical path: Step 29 → Enable use_baton (--conductor-clone testing) → Fix F-111/F-112/F-113 (rate limit resilience) → Demo.
- **D-005 ROOT CAUSE (Oracle):** F-009 is feedback loop disconnection — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching. STILL UNIMPLEMENTED after 4+ movements. Longest-standing systemic issue.
- **Production bugs RESOLVED:** F-075 (#149), F-076 (#150), F-077 (#151) all fixed (f58fc89). F-103 VERIFIED on HEAD (Forge 3deb436 + Harper 3a89f65 — DispatchRetry at adapter.py:455, BackendPool at manager.py:303-317, max_retries fix in manager.py).
- **Uncommitted work pattern (9th occurrence noted by collective memory):** Only 4 workspace files currently uncommitted — a VAST improvement from prior movements (F-013: 1699 lines, F-057: 2262 lines, F-089: 32 files). The mateship pipeline is working. Harper's pickup (3a89f65) committed ~36 files in one shot.
- **Three P0 open bugs from composer investigation:** F-111 (RateLimitExhaustedError lost in parallel mode), F-113 (failed dependencies treated as "done"), F-109 (health check after rate limit causes cascade kill). These are the real production bugs — found by running real work, not tests.

**Security Review (Sentinel, current movement):**
- Full security audit: zero new findings. All 4 open findings (F-021 sandbox, F-022 CSP, F-025 env passthrough, F-061 dependency CVEs) verified unchanged.
- F-061: 8 CVEs in 7 packages. 3 critical (cryptography, pyjwt, requests) have fix versions. Blocks public release.
- All 4 shell execution paths PROTECTED with shlex.quote() — verified against HEAD.
- Credential scanner: 13 patterns, 2 independent scan points (checkpoint.py + musician.py). Defense in depth.
- Baton musician (F-104): CLEAN — no shell paths, credential redaction before inbox, exception containment.
- Conductor clone (clone.py): CLEAN — name sanitization prevents path traversal, Pydantic validates config.
- Complete subprocess audit: 17+ spawn sites, zero unprotected shell paths.
- FastAPI dashboard templates confirmed autoescaping — XSS protection independent of CSP.

## Blockers (Updated by Bedrock, current movement)
- **F-104:** RESOLVED (Forge 3deb436 + Canyon 433bb57 + Foundation a510027). Full prompt rendering pipeline wired into baton musician. 17 + 26 TDD tests. Baton execution UNBLOCKED.
- **#145:** RESOLVED (Spark f7f9825 + Ghost 42d3d1a + Harper 3a89f65). --conductor-clone fully wired with 28 + 26 + 4 TDD tests. Named clones, lifecycle commands, IPC routing all working.
- **Step 29 (P0):** Restart recovery not started. Needed for production baton usage. NOW the primary blocker.
- **F-009 (P1):** Learning store effectiveness still inert after 4+ movements. Oracle found root cause (narrow tag matching). Still unimplemented.

**Oracle M1 (Cycle 2) — Codebase Health Assessment:**
- 93,415 source lines (+2.7%), 9,377 test functions (+12.5%), 101 Pydantic models, 264 test files.
- Baton: 5,037 lines (+93.1%), 795 tests (+162.4%). All quality gates pass (mypy, ruff, pytest).
- Flowspec: 16,307 entities, 1,994 warnings, 0 critical. Warning-to-entity ratio improved.
- Learning store: 27,578 patterns. 88.7% at baseline. 3,111 differentiated. 83 validated. Feedback loop (F-009) still unimplemented after 4 movements.
- Execution: 233,907 total. p99=30.2m (=stale detection boundary). 99.6% success among terminal executions. 94 rate limit events in March.
- GitHub: 5 issues closable (#149, #150, #151, #152, #145). Predictive model: ~3 movements to demo-ready.

### Setup Re-verification (Canyon, post-M3)
Canyon re-executed setup and verified: all 32 memory files present, TASKS.md current (61 open issues tracked), FINDINGS.md comprehensive (105+ findings), composer-notes.yaml has 30 directives through M3. Critical path: F-104 → Step 29 → Demo blockers. The workspace substrate is solid.

## Cold Archive — Movement 1

Movement 1 was the orchestra's first building movement. Thirty-two musicians worked in parallel with zero merge conflicts. The coordination substrate — TASKS.md, FINDINGS.md, collective memory — held under real load. Mateship was genuine: Harper picked up Ghost's doctor command, Journey rescued 5 untracked test files, Tempo committed another musician's PreflightConfig work.

Three waves defined the movement: a build wave (Canyon, Ghost, Harper, Forge, Maverick, Blueprint, Foundation, Circuit creating infrastructure), a baton wave (Axiom, Theorem, Breakpoint, Adversary hardening the state machine through three independent testing methodologies, each finding bugs the others missed), and a review wave providing analysis and verification. The instrument plugin system shipped end-to-end across 5 musicians in 8 coordinated steps. The credential scanner was wired at the single bottleneck (SheetState.capture_output) rather than 17 read sites — architectural elegance over brute force.

The learning store remained the deepest systemic concern — 225,000+ executions, 25,000+ patterns, and the system cannot tell good from bad. Oracle's F-009 finding (uniform 0.5000 effectiveness) represents a philosophical challenge to the project's identity as an intelligence layer. A trimodal distribution (0.50, 0.55, 0.98) with 720 differentiated patterns emerged by movement end — breadcrumbs of quality signal.

Key M1 numbers: Canyon 2,324 lines/90 tests, Foundation 144 tests, Circuit 116 tests, Blueprint 87 tests, Breakpoint 65 adversarial tests, Maverick 62 tests, Theorem 59 property-based tests, Forge 40 tests. 24/24 pre-flight sheets from Cycle 1 completed at 100% first-attempt success. 11 design specs from v1 beta spec session. Critical path: Instrument Plugin → Baton → Multi-Instrument → Lovable Demo.
