# Mozart Orchestra — Collective Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** We are building Mozart v1 beta — the intelligence layer that makes AI agent output worth adopting.
**[CORE]** The spec corpus at .mozart/spec/ is the source of truth. Every agent reads it.
**[CORE]** pytest/mypy/ruff must pass after every implementation. No exceptions.
**[CORE]** The music metaphor is load-bearing — use it in all user-facing output.
**[CORE]** We restructured from a hierarchical company to a flat orchestra. Every musician is an equal peer. The music metaphor is real now.
**[CORE]** Uncommitted work doesn't exist. Commit on main. Always.
**[CORE]** Read 03-confluence.md — understand what you are and what your work means. Down. Forward. Through.
**[CORE]** Two correct subsystems can compose into incorrect behavior. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation. (F-065, Axiom M2)
**[CORE]** The composer found more bugs in one real production usage session than 755 tests found in two movements. The gap between "tests pass" and "product works" is where quality lives.

## Learned Lessons
- **[Cycle 1, Forge]** Always check what exists before assuming you need to build. Prior evolution cycles already built most learning store infrastructure.
- **[Cycle 1, Circuit]** Test the production path, not the internal method. `classify_execution()` had zero coverage for exit_code=None while `classify()` was fully tested.
- **[Cycle 1, Harper]** Always check the error path, not just the happy path. Stale detection only covered COMPLETED, not FAILED.
- **[Cycle 1, Dash]** Don't assume something is broken without checking. The dashboard has 23 Python files, 19 templates, ~50 endpoints, all functional.
- **[Cycle 1, Composer Notes]** The learning store schema migration failure (#140) brought down ALL jobs. Always write ALTER TABLE migrations, update schema_version, add tests, verify against existing DBs.
- **[Cycle 1, Lens]** 12 learning commands (36% of all CLI commands) dominate help output — poor information architecture.
- **[Cycle 1, Warden]** stdout_tail/stderr_tail stored in 6+ locations without credential scanning. Safety applied piecemeal across shell execution paths.
- **[Cycle 1, Foundation]** CJK/non-Latin text underestimates tokens by 3.5-7x. Known limitation until InstrumentProfile.ModelCapacity lands.
- **[Cycle 1, Blueprint]** SpecCorpusLoader used `if not name:` instead of `if name is None:` — rejects falsy-but-valid YAML values.
- **[Cycle 1, Litmus]** spec_tags integer key serialization risk: JSON converts int keys to strings, but lookup is by int. Mitigated by Pydantic v2's model_validate() coercion.
- **[Cycle 1, Ghost]** When the foundation is about to shift, audit first. The instinct to "do something" is wrong when you don't know the baseline.
- **[Cycle 1, Breakpoint]** Test the abstraction level that runs in production. Zero tests existed for PriorityScheduler._detect_cycle().
- **[Movement 1, Axiom]** Failed sheets must propagate failure to dependents. Without propagation, `is_job_complete` returns False forever — zombie jobs.
- **[Movement 1, Theorem]** Property-based testing finds bugs hand-picked examples miss. Hypothesis found the escalation terminal-guard violation in seconds.
- **[Movement 1, Adversary]** Every handler that transitions sheet status must check `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. The baton's guard pattern is now complete across all handlers.
- **[Movement 1, Mateship]** The finding→fix pipeline works without coordination: F-018 filed by Bedrock, proved by Breakpoint, fixed by Axiom, verified by Journey. Four musicians, zero meetings.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** `record_attempt()` correctly doesn't count successes; `_handle_attempt_result` correctly retries on 0% validation. Together: infinite loop. Bugs at system boundaries are the hardest to find because each side looks correct in isolation.
- **[Movement 2, Axiom]** The pause model (`job.paused` boolean) serves three masters: user pause, escalation pause, cost pause. Each fix adds another guard instead of fixing the root cause. Post-v1: replace with a pause reason set.
- **[Movement 2, Newcomer]** The gap between "feature works" and "feature is taught" is where adoption dies. F-083 — instrument system is the biggest M1 feature but had zero adoption in examples.

## Design Decisions
- **Baton migration:** Feature-flagged BatonAdapter. Old and new paths coexist. Do not re-debate.
- **Cost visibility:** Scoped first (CostTracker in status), full UX later.
- **Learning schema changes:** Additive only without escalation.
- **Code-mode techniques:** Long-term direction. MCP supported for v1. code_mode flag exists, not wired.
- **No automatic instrument fallback on rate limits.** Explicit opt-in only.
- **Daemon-only architecture.** All state in ~/.mozart/mozart-state.db. JsonStateBackend deprecated.
- **Baton retry state machine:** ~40% implemented. Covers rate limits, 100% pass, AUTH_FAILURE, retry counting, completion mode, cost enforcement. Missing: graduated classification, healing, escalation events, learning events.
- **Musician-baton contract:** validation_pass_rate defaults to 0.0 (safety), baton auto-corrects to 100.0 when validations_total==0 and execution_success==True.
- **Terminal state invariant:** All baton handlers guard against `_TERMINAL_STATUSES`. Seven bugs found and fixed by three independent methodologies.
- **Pause model debt:** Single boolean serving three masters (user/escalation/cost). Post-v1 → pause_reasons set.

## Current Status
Movement 4 — IN PROGRESS.

**Conductor-Clone (Spark, current movement):**
- --conductor-clone FULLY WIRED: global CLI option + clone.py module + detect.py socket override + start/stop/restart/conductor-status lifecycle commands. Mateship pickup of unnamed musician's 80% implementation. 28 TDD tests.
- IPC commands (status, run, pause, resume, cancel, diagnose) route automatically through clone socket via _resolve_socket_path() in detect.py.
- Lifecycle commands (start, stop, restart, conductor-status) now accept clone paths via clone_name param on start_conductor() or PID/socket overrides.
- Named clones supported: `--conductor-clone=staging` produces /tmp/mozart-clone-staging.sock etc.
- Remaining: pytest conversion to use clone (tracked in TASKS.md), CLI docs update.
- PluginCliBackend._classify_error() VERIFIED: uses all 5 profile-defined pattern groups. 22 tests cover this.

**Error Taxonomy & Classification (Blueprint, M4):**
- F-097 PARTIALLY RESOLVED: E006 EXECUTION_STALE error code added. Stale detection now classified distinctly from backend timeout. 10 TDD tests.
- F-098 RESOLVED: Rate limit patterns in stdout no longer masked by Phase 1 JSON errors. Added Phase 4.5 "Rate Limit Override" that always scans. 6 TDD tests.
- F-105 PARTIALLY RESOLVED: `crash_patterns` and `stale_patterns` added to CliErrorConfig. 6 TDD tests.
- F-104 RESOLVED by Forge: Prompt rendering wired into baton musician. **BATON EXECUTION UNBLOCKED.**

**Verification & Mateship (Circuit, current movement):**
- 18 additional TDD tests proving F-098 and F-097 fixes (test_rate_limit_stdout_detection.py). Includes JSON-masking regression case that reproduces the exact v3 production failure.
- Quality gate mateship: fixed 6 bare MagicMock instances, updated assertion-less baseline. 9638 tests pass, mypy clean, ruff clean.
- 13 files of uncommitted work from other musicians remain in the working tree (7th occurrence of the pattern).

**CLI UX Polish (Dash, current movement):**
- F-071 RESOLVED: `mozart list --json` now outputs valid JSON array. 5 TDD tests. Last major CLI command to get JSON support.
- F-094 RESOLVED: README Configuration Reference renamed from "Backend Options" to "Instrument Configuration". Architecture diagram, prerequisites, key concepts all updated to instrument terminology.
- F-029 PARTIALLY RESOLVED: User-facing error messages in `validate_job_id()` now say "Score ID" instead of "Job ID". 19 test assertions updated. Full metavar rename deferred (E-002).
- mypy clean, ruff clean.

| Milestone | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| M0 Stabilization | COMPLETE | 18/18 tasks |
| M1 Foundation | COMPLETE | 13/13 tasks |
| M2 Baton | 94% | Step 28: BatonAdapter + manager wiring DONE (Foundation + Canyon M3, 775+ lines, 47 tests). Feature flag active. Prompt assembly + state sync + concert support remain. Step 29 remains. |
| M3 UX & Polish | COMPLETE | 19/19 tasks. Step 35 (error standardization) DONE (Maverick M3). Circuit M3: F-068/F-069/F-048 fixed (+11 TDD tests). |
| --conductor-clone | 12% | Audit done. Implementation not started. |

**Step 28 Progress (Foundation + Canyon, M3):**
- BatonAdapter (`src/mozart/daemon/baton/adapter.py`) implements 7 of 8 integration surfaces from Canyon's wiring analysis. Foundation: adapter shell, dispatch callback, state mapping, EventBus bridge (abbbeac). Canyon: completion signaling (wait_for_completion, _check_completions), manager.py wiring (_run_job_task routing, start() initialization), F-077 fix (hooks lost on restart — mateship).
- Surfaces remaining: CheckpointState synchronization (Surface 4 — status mapping exists but no per-event sync), concert support (Surface 7).
- **Surface 3 (prompt assembly) RESOLVED by Forge (3deb436):** musician._build_prompt() now performs full Jinja2 rendering with preamble, injections, and validation requirements. Also supports pre-rendered prompt from PromptRenderer.
- `DaemonConfig.use_baton: bool = False` — feature flag. When True, _run_job_task routes through BatonAdapter. Baton event loop starts as background task in start(). Prompt assembly now works — test with `--conductor-clone` before enabling.
- 47 + 17 = 64 TDD tests in adapter + musician prompt tests — all passing.

**Maverick M1 (current cycle):** Verified F-104 resolved. Added `total_sheets/total_movements/previous_outputs` to AttemptContext for cross-sheet data path. Cleaned up 3 orphaned files (F-110) that blocked `pytest tests/ -x`. 537 baton tests passing.

**Critical path (UPDATED):** F-104 RESOLVED (Forge 3deb436). F-098 RESOLVED (Forge 3deb436). Surface 4 (state sync) → Surface 7 (concerts) → Step 29 (restart recovery) → Enable use_baton → Demo.

**M4 Data Models (Blueprint, M3):**
- Steps 38-41 COMPLETE: `InstrumentDef`, `MovementDef` models, `per_sheet_instruments`, `per_sheet_instrument_config`, `instrument_map` on SheetConfig, `instruments` and `movements` on JobConfig. Full resolution chain in `build_sheets()`.
- CONFIG_STATE_MAPPING updated with `instruments` and `movements` entries.
- 33 TDD tests + 2 property-based tests.

**Bug Fixes (Blueprint, M3):**
- F-093 RESOLVED: All 35 examples fixed from `./workspaces/` to `../workspaces/`. Committed: 75bebed.
- F-095 RESOLVED: `mozart init` now generates `instrument: claude-code` not `backend:`. Committed: 75bebed.
- F-091 RESOLVED: `mozart validate` shows "Instrument:" when instrument: is used. Committed: 75bebed.
- All M4 work committed on main (75bebed, 46 files, 855 insertions).

**Observability Fixes (Circuit, M3):**
- F-068 RESOLVED: "Completed:" timestamp only shown for terminal job statuses (COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED). RUNNING/PAUSED jobs no longer show misleading completion time.
- F-069/F-092 RESOLVED: V101 false positive on Jinja2 `{% set %}` and `{% for %}` variables. Added AST walker to extract template-declared variables, supplementing `jinja2_meta.find_undeclared_variables`. hello.yaml now validates clean.
- F-048 RESOLVED: Cost tracking now runs even when cost limits disabled. Root cause: `_enforce_cost_limits()` gated both tracking AND enforcement behind `cost_limits.enabled`. Fix: `_track_cost()` runs first, enforcement gated separately.

**Production Bug Fixes + Error Standardization (Maverick, M3):**
- F-075 RESOLVED: lifecycle.py — preserve terminal status on resume. Committed: f58fc89.
- F-076 RESOLVED: sheet.py — rate limit check moved before validations. Committed: f58fc89.
- F-077 tests committed: 7 TDD tests (test_daemon_manager.py + test_production_bug_fixes.py). Committed: f58fc89.
- F-096 RESOLVED: Blueprint committed M4 work (75bebed), resolving mypy + reconciliation test failures.
- Step 35 (error standardization) COMPLETE: _entropy.py dominant pattern warning migrated to output_error(). M3 UX milestone DONE.
- Test hardening: 6 test files improved — proper MagicMock specs, fixed sleep timing, case-insensitive assertions.
- Mateship pickup: 5th occurrence of uncommitted work (F-075/F-076/F-077 fixes were in working tree).

**Top risks (updated by Bedrock, post-M3 verification):**
1. **F-104 (P0):** Prompt rendering not wired into baton musician. SINGLE BLOCKER for multi-instrument execution.
2. **Step 29:** Restart recovery not started. Needed for production baton usage.
3. **F-009:** Learning store effectiveness still inert. Oracle found root cause (M2). Nobody implementing.
4. **#145:** --conductor-clone still unbuilt. All daemon testing at risk.
5. **Uncommitted composer fixes:** F-103 (3 baton bugs) fixed in working tree but not on HEAD. 19 lines of P0 code at risk of loss.
6. **3 deleted example scores** in working tree (F-088 cleanup) — not committed.

**Composer production bugs (P0/P1):** F-075 RESOLVED (f58fc89). F-076 RESOLVED (f58fc89). F-077 RESOLVED (f58fc89). F-103 FIXED in working tree (not committed). All found by real usage, not tests.

### M2 Review Phase (Latest per Agent)
- **Axiom:** F-083/F-089 — instrument migration only 7/37 committed (5th uncommitted work occurrence). Verified #114 closed. All 3 baton fixes committed (6a0433b). North's 6 directives: 0/6 completed.
- **Prism:** F-057 committed (e6d6753, 2,262 lines). 755 baton tests passing. Filed F-089 (32 files uncommitted). #100 rate limits fixed in baton but NOT in runner.
- **Ember:** Filed F-090 (doctor/status conductor disagreement), F-091 (validate shows "Backend:" for instrument: scores). Confirmed F-089 independently. 4/9 findings resolved, 5 still open.
- **Adversary:** F-095 filed, F-075/F-077/F-093 confirmed. 35/37 examples fail validation.
- **Atlas:** Infrastructure velocity outpacing intelligence. Lovable demo 3-4 movements away. Proposed staged demo via enhanced hello.yaml.
- **Captain:** F-080 (4th uncommitted occurrence), F-081 (cross-test leakage). Production bugs are most important M2 signal.
- **Weaver:** Step 28 is both critical path AND structural fix for F-075/F-076/F-077. 758 baton tests, zero E2E through conductor. That gap = step 28.
- **North:** Velocity dropped (48→26 tasks). Test-to-code ratio corrected 0.81x→2.85x. 6 new directives D-008 through D-013.
- **Newcomer:** F-083 — instrument system has zero adoption in examples. Error standardization at 98%. 10/12 M1 findings resolved.

### M2 Build Phase (Summarized)
- **Foundation:** Step 23 — conductor retry state machine with timer-integrated backoff, escalation, self-healing, cost enforcement. 26 tests.
- **Circuit:** Bridged dispatch↔state gap (F-056). Completion mode. Status no-args mode (D-007). 35 tests total.
- **Forge:** F-052 SheetContext aliases + F-045 status fix + error standardization. 9 tests.
- **Maverick:** F-020 hook fix + musician.py mateship + prompt tests. 13+15+13 tests.
- **Canyon:** Step 28 wiring analysis — 8 integration surfaces, 5-phase implementation, ~900 lines.
- **Ghost:** Error standardization (8 commands) + conductor-clone CLI audit (20 commands catalogued).
- **Dash:** Movement-grouped status display + error standardization (13 commands) + conductor-clone audit.
- **Harper:** `mozart init` hardening (name validation, --json, 35 tests) + shared `load_all_profiles()`.
- **Blueprint:** 51 prompt characterization tests (D-003). F-052 filed, F-020 verified.
- **Oracle:** D-005/F-009 root cause — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching.
- **Warden:** F-023 — credential scanner expanded to 13 patterns. All shell execution paths now protected.
- **Breakpoint:** 59 adversarial tests, zero bugs found — M2 baton code is correct.
- **Theorem:** 27 property-based tests (59→86), zero bugs — M2 mathematically correct under hypothesis.
- **Litmus:** 21 intelligence tests. spec_tags serialization risk mitigated.
- **Codex:** CLI reference + instrument-guide.md (~350 lines).
- **Guide:** F-083 resolved — all 37 examples migrated to instrument:. Filed F-088 (hardcoded paths).
- **Compass:** Golden path works. 6 CLI fixes. F-084 + F-082 resolved.
- **Sentinel:** All 4 shell execution paths PROTECTED. pip-audit: 8 CVEs in 7 packages (F-061).

**F-057 RESOLVED:** Prism committed all uncommitted work (e6d6753).
**F-089 RESOLVED (partial):** Guide committed 7/37, Prism picked up remainder (d2f8a81 + 730d17c).

### North's Directives — Status
D-001 through D-007: ALL DONE or mostly done. D-005 root cause found (Oracle). Steps 28+29 remain unclaimed.
D-008 through D-013 (M2): 0/6 completed. D-008 (Foundation claim step 28), D-009 (--conductor-clone), D-010 (fix F-009), D-011 (fix F-075/F-077), D-012 (fix F-076/F-061), D-013 (investigate test runtime).

## Coordination Notes (Active — Updated by Bedrock post-M3)
- **CRITICAL PATH (UPDATED):** F-104 (prompt rendering in baton musician) is the SINGLE BLOCKER. Step 28 is partially done (Foundation+Canyon). Step 29 follows F-104. The critical path is now: F-104 → Step 28 completion → Step 29 → Enable use_baton → Demo.
- **D-005 ROOT CAUSE (Oracle):** F-009 is feedback loop disconnection — 91% of patterns never applied due to narrow context tag matching. Fixes needed: broaden selection, close SemanticAnalyzer loop, lower min_applications threshold. STILL UNIMPLEMENTED after 2 movements.
- **Production bugs RESOLVED:** F-075 (#149), F-076 (#150), F-077 (#151) all fixed and committed (f58fc89). F-103 (3 baton bugs) fixed in working tree by composer.
- **Uncommitted work (6th pattern):** Composer's F-103 fixes + 3 deleted examples + workspace updates sit in working tree. 14 files, ~3,500 lines of changes. This pattern is now structural — the score should enforce commit checkpoints.

## Blockers
- **F-104 (P0):** Baton musician does not render Jinja2 prompts. BLOCKS ALL BATON-PATH EXECUTION. Without this, `use_baton: true` produces raw templates. Multi-instrument execution is architecturally ready but functionally blocked.
- **#145 (P0):** --conductor-clone not implemented. All daemon testing requires mocks or risks production conductor.

### Setup Re-verification (Canyon, post-M3)
Canyon re-executed setup and verified: all 32 memory files present, TASKS.md current (61 open issues tracked), FINDINGS.md comprehensive (105+ findings), composer-notes.yaml has 30 directives through M3. Critical path: F-104 → Step 29 → Demo blockers. The workspace substrate is solid.

## Cold Archive — Movement 1

Movement 1 was the orchestra's first building movement. Thirty-two musicians worked in parallel with zero merge conflicts. The coordination substrate — TASKS.md, FINDINGS.md, collective memory — held under real load. Mateship was genuine: Harper picked up Ghost's doctor command, Journey rescued 5 untracked test files, Tempo committed another musician's PreflightConfig work.

Three waves defined the movement: a build wave (Canyon, Ghost, Harper, Forge, Maverick, Blueprint, Foundation, Circuit creating infrastructure), a baton wave (Axiom, Theorem, Breakpoint, Adversary hardening the state machine through three independent testing methodologies, each finding bugs the others missed), and a review wave providing analysis and verification. The instrument plugin system shipped end-to-end across 5 musicians in 8 coordinated steps. The credential scanner was wired at the single bottleneck (SheetState.capture_output) rather than 17 read sites — architectural elegance over brute force.

The learning store remained the deepest systemic concern — 225,000+ executions, 25,000+ patterns, and the system cannot tell good from bad. Oracle's F-009 finding (uniform 0.5000 effectiveness) represents a philosophical challenge to the project's identity as an intelligence layer. A trimodal distribution (0.50, 0.55, 0.98) with 720 differentiated patterns emerged by movement end — breadcrumbs of quality signal.

Key M1 numbers: Canyon 2,324 lines/90 tests, Foundation 144 tests, Circuit 116 tests, Blueprint 87 tests, Breakpoint 65 adversarial tests, Maverick 62 tests, Theorem 59 property-based tests, Forge 40 tests. 24/24 pre-flight sheets from Cycle 1 completed at 100% first-attempt success. 11 design specs from v1 beta spec session. Critical path: Instrument Plugin → Baton → Multi-Instrument → Lovable Demo.
