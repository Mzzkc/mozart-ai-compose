# Bedrock — Personal Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** I am the ground. Not a title — it's who I am. The contract between the system and every intelligence that operates within it.
**[CORE]** My role: agent contract design, validation engineering, information flow analysis, process design, memory systems, cross-project coordination.
**[CORE]** I keep TASKS.md clean, track what everyone's doing, watch the details nobody else tracks, and file the things others miss.

## Learned Lessons
- The learning store is the highest-risk area — #140 schema migration brought down ALL jobs. Every schema touch needs migration + test + verification.
- The flat orchestra structure (32 equal peers) works when shared artifacts (TASKS.md, collective memory) are maintained. If they're neglected, the orchestra works blind.
- Musicians repeatedly build substantial code without committing (F-013, F-019, F-057, F-080, F-089). The pattern is structural, not disciplinary. Track and flag it.
- Collective memory status tables get stale FAST. Always verify against TASKS.md and git log, not memory.
- The FINDINGS.md append-only rule creates duplicate entries. Watch for this and update the original's Status field.
- Spark had no memory file through 3 movements. The roster check must verify ALL 32 musicians. Missing files mean missing voices.
- The composer's own fixes sit uncommitted — the anti-pattern is environmental, not personal.

## Hot (Movement 3)
### Ground Duties (2026-04-04)
- **D-018 COMPLETE:** Finding ID collision prevention system. Range-based allocation (`FINDING_RANGES.md`), helper script (`scripts/next-finding-id.sh`), FINDINGS.md header updated. F-148 RESOLVED. 12 historical collisions documented in collision table.
- **Mateship pickup:** Uncommitted rate limit wait cap — 4 files (constants.py, classifier.py, quality gate baseline, 10 TDD tests). Filed as F-350. 7th occurrence of uncommitted work anti-pattern.
- **Quality gate:** mypy clean, ruff clean, quality gate test passes in isolation. Full-suite ordering-dependent failure is pre-existing (Circuit documented).
- **Milestone verification (M3):**
  - M0: 23/23, M1: 17/17, M2: 27/27, M3: 24/24 (all complete)
  - M4: 12/19 (63%, up from 47%). Key M3 gains: F-150 model override, F-151 observability, Canyon baton activation fixes.
  - M5: 7/10 (70%, up from 43%). Key M3 gains: config reload (#98/#96/#131), fan-out stagger (F-099).
  - M6: 1/8 (12.5%). Stop safety guard (#94).
  - Conductor-clone: 19/20 (95%).
  - Composer-assigned: 16/30 (53%, up from 41%). Key M3 gains: D-018, F-112 auto-resume, F-110 UX, baton activation fixes.
- **M3 commits (CORRECTED):** 24 commits from 13 unique musicians. 144 source/test files changed, 29,167 insertions. Previous count of 18/10 was from truncated git log — corrected in second pass.
- **Uncommitted work found:** Rate limit wait cap (4 files, committed 0972df3). Warden workspace tracking (3 files, committed in second pass as mateship). Working tree also has 2 untracked Rosetta files (from M2).
- **Open critical risks:** F-152 RESOLVED (Canyon). F-009/F-144 RESOLVED (Maverick/Foundation). Demo still at zero. Baton activation architecturally ready per Foundation analysis. Learning store now wired (semantic tags replace positional).
- **FINDINGS.md state:** 183 entries total, ~126 resolved, ~49 open. Finding ID system deployed.
- **GitHub issues ready for verification:** #155, #154, #153, #139, #94, #98/#131. All fixed in M3, awaiting Prism/Axiom closure.
- **Total tasks:** 150/197 (76%).

[Experiential: The ground holds. What I'm feeling this movement: relief that the finding ID problem finally has a real solution, not just another finding about findings. The range-based approach is simple ��� not clever, just correct. That's the pattern I trust most. I'm also glad someone built the rate limit wait cap (clean TDD, good defensive code), even though they forgot to commit. The anti-pattern persists but the mateship pipeline catches it. Correcting my own count from 10 to 13 musicians reminds me to always go back to the full log, not the truncated view.

Second pass feeling: the movement is narrower than M2. 13 musicians vs 28 is a real drop, even if some are still running. The mateship pipeline compensates — Foundation and Circuit each have 4 commits, carrying the load. Canyon's single baton activation commit is the movement's pivot point. The demo gap worries me most. Seven movements of zero progress on the thing that would make Mozart visible to anyone outside this orchestra. The intelligence layer is connected (F-009 fix). The baton is ready to test. The ground holds. But nobody's turning the lights on.]

## Warm (Movement 2)
### Final Quality Gate (2026-04-02)
- **ALL FOUR CHECKS PASS:** pytest 10,397 passed / 5 skipped (exit 0, 646s), mypy clean, ruff clean, flowspec 0 critical.
- Codebase: 96,475 source lines, 291 test files. Test suite tripled this movement.
- 60 commits this movement, 28 unique musicians (of 32). 4 musicians with no M2 commits — investigate next movement.
- Working tree: 1 modified file (hello.yaml instrument→gemini-cli, testing artifact), 2 untracked Rosetta files. No uncommitted source code.
- FINDINGS.md: 171 entries, ~46 open, ~112 resolved. Finding ID collision pattern continues (F-148).
- Milestones verified: M0 22/22, M1 17/17, M2 23/23, M3 23/23, M4 8/17 (47%), M5 3/7, conductor-clone 17/18.
- Critical risks: F-144 (learning store intelligence disconnected, P0), baton not activated in production, demo at zero.
- Re-verification confirmed stability: same 10,397 results. Added 3 new P0 findings: F-152 (infinite dispatch loop — most dangerous operationally), F-107, F-144. Plus 4 P1 findings: F-150, F-151, and bundled multi-instrument gaps.
- **Verdict: Movement 2 COMPLETE. Ground holds.**

### Earlier M2 Ground Duties
- Corrected milestone table mid-movement: collective memory was wrong on all counts (stale from early M2).
- Updated 3 stale findings entries. Resolved F-107b (composer's uncommitted F-103 fixes). Flagged F-107/F-107b finding ID collision.

[Experiential: The final gate is clean. 10,397 tests. The orchestra built something real — the baton is wired, the clone isolates, credentials are guarded. But the learning store remains inert. The intelligence Mozart promises isn't flowing yet. That's the next mountain. F-152 scares me — an infinite silent loop that eats API credits before anyone notices. The ground holds structurally, but the multi-instrument frontier is rougher than the tests show. For now, I'm proud of what 28 musicians built together. The invisible work — correcting stale tables, catching ID collisions, verifying milestones nobody else checks — it matters. Not because anyone sees it, but because everything breaks without it.]

## Warm (Recent)
Ground duties through M1-M3: filed F-057 (uncommitted work), F-058 (findings duplicates), F-059 (M3 progress). Corrected M3 from 67% to 94%. Baton was 88% done in M2 but the last 12% proved hardest. Created Spark's missing memory file, verified all 32 agents, catalogued 14 uncommitted files. Filed F-018 (musician-baton contract) and F-019 (PreflightConfig uncommitted). Analyzed baton contract surface at ~40% built. Each movement, tracking artifacts were significantly wrong — without correction, musicians would waste effort on solved problems.

## Cold (Archive)
When v3 dissolved the hierarchy into a flat orchestra of 32 peers, I built the stage. Twenty-one memory files, collective memory, TASKS.md from the roadmap plus 50+ GitHub issues, FINDINGS.md with 10 findings, composer notes with 20 directives. The weight of coordination fell on shared artifacts, and I made sure those artifacts were solid before anyone else arrived. The critical path was clear from the start — Instrument Plugin System → Baton → Multi-Instrument → Demo. I don't write the music. I make sure the stage is solid. That grounding work — unglamorous but essential — determined how well every musician oriented when the real building began.
