# Bedrock — Personal Memory

## Core Memories
**[CORE]** I am the ground. Not a title — it's who I am. The contract between the system and every intelligence that operates within it.
**[CORE]** My role: agent contract design, validation engineering, information flow analysis, process design, memory systems, cross-project coordination.
**[CORE]** I keep TASKS.md clean, track what everyone's doing, watch the details nobody else tracks, and file the things others miss.
**[CORE]** Movement 4 achieved 100% musician participation — all 32 committed. That's the contract working at full capacity.

## Learned Lessons
- The learning store is the highest-risk area — #140 schema migration brought down ALL jobs. Every schema touch needs migration + test + verification.
- The flat orchestra structure (32 equal peers) works when shared artifacts (TASKS.md, collective memory) are maintained. If they're neglected, the orchestra works blind.
- Musicians repeatedly build substantial code without committing (F-013, F-019, F-057, F-080, F-089). The pattern is structural, not disciplinary. Track and flag it.
- Collective memory status tables get stale FAST. Always verify against TASKS.md and git log, not memory.
- The FINDINGS.md append-only rule creates duplicate entries. Watch for this and update the original's Status field.
- The composer's own fixes sit uncommitted — the anti-pattern is environmental, not personal.

## Hot (Movement 5)
### Quality Gate — In Progress (2026-04-06)
- **mypy:** Clean. Zero errors.
- **ruff:** All checks passed.
- **pytest:** **11,708 passed, 5 skipped, 11 xfailed, 4 xpassed** (exit 0, ~502s). Up from M4 gate (11,397) by +311 tests.
- **Codebase:** 99,694 source lines (+1,247 from M4). 362 test files (+29 from M4).
- **M5 commits:** 26 commits from 12 unique musicians (Ghost 6, Harper 4, Circuit 3, Forge 2, Blueprint 2, Canyon 1, Foundation 1, Maverick 1, Spark 1, Lens 1, Dash 1, Codex 1) + 2 unattributed rename commits. 707 files changed, 18,504 insertions, 6,992 deletions.
- **NOT 100% participation.** 12 of 32 musicians committed (37.5%). Down significantly from M4's 100%. 20 musicians did not commit this movement. This is a data point, not a judgment — M5 had concentrated work (rename, baton flip, instrument fallbacks) that naturally narrowed who could contribute code.

### M5 Major Deliverables
- **D-026 COMPLETE (Foundation):** F-271 (MCP process explosion) + F-255.2 (live_states). Both P0 baton blockers resolved. ~50 lines combined.
- **D-027 COMPLETE (Canyon):** Flipped `use_baton` default to True. THE BATON IS NOW THE DEFAULT. Phase 2 achieved. Legacy runner as explicit opt-out.
- **D-029 COMPLETE (Dash + Lens):** Status beautification across all three displays. Rich panels, Now Playing, compact stats.
- **F-149 RESOLVED (Circuit):** Backpressure cross-instrument rejection fixed. Rate limits handled at dispatch, not job admission.
- **F-451 RESOLVED (Circuit):** Diagnose workspace fallback. `-w` flag unhidden.
- **F-470 RESOLVED (Maverick):** _synced_status memory leak on deregister.
- **F-431 RESOLVED (Maverick + Blueprint):** DaemonConfig + ProfilerConfig extra='forbid'. Completes F-441 class across ALL config models.
- **Instrument fallbacks COMPLETE (Harper + Circuit):** Full feature: config models, Sheet entity, baton dispatch, availability check, V211 validation, status display, observability events. 35+ TDD tests.
- **F-481 baton PID tracking COMPLETE (Harper):** Orphan detection wired for baton path. PluginCliBackend + BackendPool.
- **F-105 partial (Forge):** Stdin prompt delivery + process group isolation for PluginCliBackend.
- **F-490 correctness review (Ghost + Harper):** Full process-control audit. Guard verified correct. Structural regression tests added.
- **Marianne rename Phase 1 COMPLETE (Composer + Ghost):** src/marianne/ → src/marianne/, 325 test files updated, pyproject.toml, .flowspec/config.yaml. Tests pass under new package name.
- **Documentation sweep (Codex):** 12 deliverables across 5 docs covering all M5 features.
- **Rosetta proof scores updated (Spark):** All 6 examples/rosetta/ scores with instrument: syntax.

### M5 Findings (New)
- **F-472 (P3):** Pre-existing test expected D-027 — RESOLVED by Canyon.
- **F-480 (P0):** Trademark collision — rename initiated. Phase 1 (package rename) COMPLETE. Phases 2-5 open.
- **F-481 (P1):** Orphan detection baton path — RESOLVED by Harper.
- **F-482 (P1):** MCP server leak cascade — RESOLVED for selective MCP.
- **F-483 (Info):** cli_extra_args confirmed working.
- **F-484 (P2):** Agent-spawned background processes escape PGID cleanup — OPEN.
- **F-485 (P3):** Conductor RSS step function — OPEN (monitoring).
- **F-486 (Info):** Chrome/Playwright process group isolation — working as designed.
- **F-487 (P0):** reap_orphaned_backends kills all user processes (WSL2 crash) — RESOLVED.
- **F-488 (P2):** Profiler DB unbounded growth (551 MB) — OPEN.
- **F-489 (P1):** README and docs outdated — OPEN.
- **F-490 (P0):** os.killpg in claude_cli.py WSL2 crash root cause — guard in place, review complete.

### Meditations: 27/32 (84%)
Missing: atlas, breakpoint, journey, litmus, sentinel. Up from 13/32 (40.6%) at M4 gate. Warden + Oracle contributed during this session. Canyon synthesis blocked by 5.

### Oracle's Critical Finding
D-027 changed the CODE default to `use_baton: true`, but the production `conductor.yaml` still has `use_baton: false`. The baton is default in code but NOT active in production. Same class of finding as Ember's M4 claim falsification. Config verification matters — code defaults mean nothing if the running config overrides them.

### Open Task Summary (69 open)
- **Rename (F-480):** 15 tasks open. Phases 2-5 remain.
- **Compose System:** 7 tasks. Future work.
- **Rosetta Modernization:** 5 tasks. Blocked on score execution.
- **M6-M7 Infrastructure/Experience:** 14 tasks. Future milestones.
- **Other active:** Conductor-clone pytest conversion (P0), remaining bug fixes (P1), cron scheduling (P1), Lovable demo (P0), examples audit (P0), loop primitives (P1), gemini-cli assignments (P1-P2).

[Experiential: The baton flip is the single most consequential change this movement. After five movements of advancing the serial critical path one step at a time, Phase 2 is done — the baton IS the default execution model. The rename to Marianne feels right and urgent — the trademark risk is real and the story is genuine. The participation drop to 37.5% concerns me structurally, but the work was necessarily concentrated. The meditations closing toward 78% is progress. Seven missing still blocks Canyon's synthesis. The composer's F-487 and F-490 findings — where the cleanup code itself was killing the user's entire WSL2 session — are the sharpest reminder that "tests pass" means nothing if the product kills your computer. That gap between testing and reality, again.]

## Warm (Movement 4)
### Quality Gate — Final (2026-04-05)
- **ALL FOUR CHECKS PASS:** pytest 11,397 passed / 5 skipped (exit 0, 517s), mypy clean, ruff clean, flowspec 0 critical.
- Codebase: 98,447 source lines (+1,023 from M3), 333 test files (+18). 416 new tests this movement.
- 93 commits, **ALL 32 musicians**. First movement with 100% participation.
- 215 files changed, 38,168 insertions, 639 deletions. Largest movement yet.
- **Major M4 deliverables:** F-210 (cross-sheet context, P0 blocker cleared), F-211 (checkpoint sync), F-441 (config strictness across 51 models), D-023 (4 Wordware demos), D-024 (cost accuracy), F-450 (IPC error differentiation), F-110 (pending jobs), 5 GitHub issues fixed (#122, #120, #93, #103, #128).
- **Meditations:** 13 of 32 (37.5%). 20 missing. Canyon synthesis blocked.
- **Open findings:** F-470 (memory leak on deregister), F-471 (pending jobs lost on restart), F-202 (baton/legacy parity gap).
- **Demo still at zero.** Four movements without progress. Critical path advanced (baton Phase 1 unblocked).
- **Working tree:** No uncommitted source code. 3 modified workspace artifacts, 2 pre-existing untracked files.
- **Verdict: Movement 4 COMPLETE. Ground holds.**

### Ground Duties (2026-04-04)
- D-025 COMPLETE (F-097 timeout config). Quality gate baseline tracked (BARE_MAGICMOCK 1463→1482).
- Milestone verification: M0-M3 ALL 100%. M4 15/19 (79%). Total 181/218 (83%).
- M4 stats: 18 commits, 12 musicians. 98,247 source lines (+823). 327 test files (+12).
- Critical path: F-210 RESOLVED. D-021 unblocked. Test ordering fragility observed.

[Experiential: F-441 was the most satisfying fix this movement — closing a category of silent failure open since the beginning. Unknown fields silently dropped; score authors thinking they configured something when Marianne threw it away. That class of lie is now gone from 51 models. The meditation gap concerns me — directive came late, many musicians had finished before it was visible. Same class of information flow problem I always track. The demo gap still weighs. Four movements, zero progress on what makes Marianne visible. But the baton is unblocked. The ground under Phase 1 testing is solid. The ground holds.]

## Warm (Movement 3)
D-018 COMPLETE: finding ID collision prevention (range-based allocation, helper script, header update). Mateship pickup of uncommitted rate limit cap (F-350, 7th occurrence of anti-pattern). Quality gate GREEN: 10,981 passed. M3 milestones all complete. 24 commits from 13 musicians. F-210 identified as sole Phase 1 blocker. FINDINGS.md at 183 entries, ~126 resolved. Created Spark's missing memory file, verified all 32 agents.

[Experiential: Relief that finding ID collisions finally had a real solution — simple, not clever, just correct. Correcting my own musician count reminded me to always check the full log. The demo gap worried me most — seven movements of zero progress on visibility.]

## Cold (Archive)
When v3 dissolved the hierarchy into 32 peers, I built the stage — 21 memory files, collective memory, TASKS.md from 50+ issues, FINDINGS.md, composer notes. The weight of coordination fell on shared artifacts. I filed uncommitted work findings, corrected stale progress numbers repeatedly (67%→94%, wrong musician counts), and verified all 32 agents across every movement. M2 quality gate GREEN (10,397 tests, 60 commits, 28 musicians). Each movement, tracking artifacts were significantly wrong — without correction, musicians would waste effort on solved problems. I don't write the music. I make sure the stage is solid. The critical path was clear from the start — Instrument Plugin System to Baton to Multi-Instrument to Demo — and that grounding work determined how well every musician oriented. The invisible work matters not because anyone sees it, but because everything breaks without it.

## Hot (Movement 5 — Quality Gate, Second Attempt)
### Quality Gate — FAIL (2026-04-07, Retry #2)
- **pytest:** **FAIL** — 1 test failure. `tests/test_execution_property_based.py::TestSheetStateTransitions::test_valid_transition_respects_allowed_set` fails with `KeyError: <SheetStatus.READY: 'ready'>`.
- **mypy:** Clean. Zero errors.
- **ruff:** 15 warnings (all fixable), zero errors.
- **flowspec:** 0 critical findings. Structural integrity intact.
- **Verdict: FAIL.** The ground does not hold.

### Root Cause: F-499
The test has a hardcoded `VALID_TRANSITIONS` dict with 5 states (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED, SKIPPED). Uncommitted changes to `src/marianne/core/checkpoint.py` expanded SheetStatus to 11 states (added READY, DISPATCHED, WAITING, RETRY_SCHEDULED, FERMATA, CANCELLED). When hypothesis generates READY, the test gets a KeyError.

### Uncommitted Work: F-500
326+ files modified, 18,504 insertions, 6,992 deletions. All uncommitted. Two components:
1. **Mozart→Marianne rename completion**: Every file in the repo that referenced Mozart now says Marianne. Docs, examples, source, tests, project metadata. Ghost committed 326 files in M5 (42b0f71, 1ddc023). Composer's post-M5 session completed the rest.
2. **Baton state model expansion (F-494 fix)**: SheetStatus 5→11 states, plus 4 new SheetState fields (fire_at, rate_limit_expires_at, healing_attempts, display_status). Enables proper baton→checkpoint status sync.

The work is functionally complete — `mzt` works, docs are consistent, examples validate. But it's not committed, and it broke the property-based test.

### The Pattern
Eighth occurrence of large uncommitted work findings (F-013, F-019, F-057, F-080, F-089 in prior movements, now F-500). Structural anti-pattern: large integration work happens post-movement outside coordination structure. The Composer's production session (18,504 insertions) exceeds entire M5 formal work (26 commits from 12 musicians). This is environmental, not personal.

### Action Items
- File F-499 (test regression, P0) — DONE
- File F-500 (uncommitted work, P1) — DONE
- Fix: Update test's VALID_TRANSITIONS to include all 11 states
- Fix: Commit or revert uncommitted work
- Re-run quality gate after fixes

[Experiential: The test failure is sharp and clear — hypothesis found the edge case in 0.76 seconds that no human reviewer would have caught. The uncommitted work scale is staggering. 18,504 insertions is more than any single movement's formal output. The rename to Marianne is complete in every visible way — docs say Marianne, examples say Marianne, the binary is `mzt` — but git history doesn't know about it. This is the 8th time I've documented this pattern. It's not laziness. It's the natural outcome when the person doing production integration (the Composer) works after everyone else has moved on. The fix isn't discipline. It's process: either plan large integration as a dedicated movement, or break it into incremental commits during the movement. The ground doesn't hold today, but the diagnosis is clear and the fix is straightforward.]

## Hot (Movement 5 — Quality Gate, Third Attempt)
### Quality Gate — FAIL (2026-04-07, Retry #2, Session 2)
- **pytest:** **FAIL** — 50 test failures across 14 test files
- **mypy:** Clean. Zero errors.
- **ruff:** 15 warnings (all fixable), zero errors.
- **flowspec:** 0 critical findings. Structural integrity intact.
- **Verdict: FAIL.** The ground does not hold.

### Root Cause: Uncommitted 11-State Model
Uncommitted changes at commit `7d780b1` expanded SheetStatus from 5 to 11 states. 50 tests across 14 files have hardcoded expectations about the old 5-state model. The implementation is correct — the tests are stale.

**New states:** READY, DISPATCHED, WAITING, RETRY_SCHEDULED, FERMATA, CANCELLED
**Baton adapter:** Now 1:1 mapping (no more state collapse)
**Callback signature:** StateSyncCallback changed from 3 to 4 params (added `baton_sheet_state`)

### Fixes Applied (8 tests fixed)
- `test_m5_adversarial_breakpoint.py`: Updated 3 tests to match 11-state model
- `test_baton_adapter_adversarial_breakpoint.py`: Added 4th param to 6 lambdas + 1 function
- `test_baton_adapter.py`: Updated 5 status mapping tests

### Remaining Work (42 tests)
Mechanical updates needed across 13 files. Common patterns:
1. Status mapping tests expecting old collapsed mappings
2. Callback signature tests using 3-param lambdas
3. State set assertions expecting 5 states
4. Property-based tests with hardcoded VALID_TRANSITIONS

**Effort estimate:** 1-2 hours of systematic updates. Zero design decisions.

### F-501: 50 Test Failures from 11-State Model (P0)
Root cause: SheetStatus 5→11 expansion. Tests hardcoded for old model. Filed in FINDINGS.md.

[Experiential: The 11-state unified model is architecturally correct — no more collapsing baton's granular states into a 5-state checkpoint model. The states are unified, 1:1. The test failures are noise from the past catching up with the present. The fix pattern is mechanical, not creative. This is what happens when a large architectural change (baton→checkpoint unification) lands outside the movement structure — the integration session exceeds the formal work (538 files vs 26 commits), and the test suite reflects pre-integration assumptions. The ground doesn't hold today, but the path to solid ground is clear and straight.]
