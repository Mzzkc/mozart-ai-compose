## CRITICAL: --conductor-clone (BLOCKS ALL TESTING)

This is the highest priority task. You are running inside a live conductor. You cannot test against it.

- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Implement --conductor-clone as a global CLI option (priority: P0) [source: composer directive, movement 1] — Spark: mateship pickup of unnamed musician's clone.py + detect.py + cli/__init__.py. Added clone_name param to start_conductor in process.py, wired start/restart/conductor-status with clone paths. 28 TDD tests.
- [x] [Ghost] Full accounting of ALL mozart CLI commands — which ones interact with the daemon? (priority: P0) — Audit at movement-2/cli-daemon-audit.md: 20 commands, 14 interact with daemon, 10 IPC methods, 3 direct DaemonClient sites, implementation recommendations
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Each daemon-interacting command gains --conductor-clone support (priority: P0) — IPC commands route via _resolve_socket_path() clone override. Lifecycle commands (start/stop/restart/conductor-status) wired with clone PID/socket/config overrides.
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Clone conductor uses isolated socket (/tmp/mozart-clone.sock), PID (/tmp/mozart-clone.pid), state DB, logs (priority: P0) — resolve_clone_paths() + build_clone_config(). start_conductor() applies clone path overrides to loaded config.
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Clone inherits production daemon config unless overridden (priority: P0) — _load_config() runs normally, then clone paths applied on top via model_dump/model_validate.
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Support named clones: --conductor-clone=name (priority: P1) — _sanitize_name() ensures safe file paths. Named clones produce unique paths: /tmp/mozart-clone-{name}.sock etc.
- [x] [Harper] Harden clone name sanitization: long name truncation (64 char cap), fix TYPE_CHECKING type signatures (object→DaemonConfig). 26 TDD tests in test_conductor_clone_hardening.py covering adversarial inputs, config inheritance, path isolation, built-in profile validation. (priority: P1) [source: mateship review of Spark's clone implementation]
- [x] [Ghost] Fix config_cmd.py _try_live_config() to use _resolve_socket_path() instead of hardcoded DaemonConfig().socket.path — last direct DaemonClient site bypassing clone. Completed Spark's TDD tests (TestConfigCmdCloneAwareness). (priority: P1) [source: F-090 / cli daemon audit]
- [x] [Ghost] Fix F-090: doctor.py two-phase conductor detection — PID file + IPC socket fallback. Also clone-aware via _resolve_socket_path(). 4 TDD tests. (priority: P1) [source: F-090]
- [x] [Canyon] Fix F-132: build_clone_config() doesn't override state_db_path — clone shares production registry (priority: P1) [source: F-132, Newcomer M1C7] — 1-line fix in clone.py:144. 3 TDD tests. F-132 RESOLVED.
- [x] [Harper] Fix F-122: Replace all 5 hardcoded DaemonClient socket paths with _resolve_socket_path(None). Hooks, MCP, dashboard routes, job_control, app factory. 14 TDD tests. (priority: P1) [source: F-122]
- [x] [Harper] Fix F-131: Update --conductor-clone help text to require = syntax. (priority: P3) [source: F-131]
- [x] [Ghost] Convert F-122 adversarial tests from "prove bug exists" to "prove fix holds" regression tests. All 4 now assert _resolve_socket_path IS used and hardcoded paths are NOT. (priority: P1) [source: F-122 test maintenance]
- [x] [Ghost] Fix 3 mypy errors in baton core.py — logger.debug() used event_type= kwarg instead of extra={"event_type": ...} for StaleCheck, CronTick, PacingComplete handlers. (priority: P1) [source: mypy strict]
- [x] [Ghost] Close 3 verified GitHub issues: #95 (workspace path validation), #112 (health check quota), #99 (hooks lost on restart). All fixes verified on HEAD. (priority: P1) [source: issue hygiene]
- [x] [Circuit] Fix test_register_methods_wires_rpc: add daemon.clear_rate_limits to expected IPC method set (priority: P1) [source: mateship review of Harper ae31ca8] — Harper's clear-rate-limits commit added a new IPC method but didn't update the IPC contract test.
- [ ] Convert ALL pytests that touch the daemon to use --conductor-clone or appropriate mocking (priority: P0)
- [x] [Dash] Audit CLI UX during the full command accounting — document improvement opportunities (priority: P1) — Full audit at movement-2/cli-ux-audit.md: 6 issues (2 P1, 2 P2, 2 P3), grade B+. Fixed: --job→--score in top.py/clear, clear docstring clarified, modify docstring improved, resume "job state"→"score state". Filed: learning commands domination (12/26) needs E-002 escalation for subcommand refactor.
- [x] [Ember] Fix top.py help examples and notes using --job after Dash renamed flag to --score (priority: P3) [source: F-142, mateship pickup] — 4 user-facing strings updated: help example, TUI note, history note, docstring. Commit 5093962.
- [x] [Codex] Update CLI reference docs to document --conductor-clone (priority: P1) — Already documented in M2 by previous Codex session (lines 18-55). This movement added 4 missing commands (init, cancel, clear, top), --profile on start, and conductor clones section to daemon-guide.

- [x] [Lens] instruments.py JSON error path: console.print(json.dumps) → output_json() for Rich markup safety. 7 TDD regression tests for rejection hint behavior (test_rejection_hints_ux.py). Commit 4b83dae. (priority: P2) [source: error standardization]
- [x] [Newcomer] Fix F-153/F-460: "job" → "score" terminology across CLI + docs — run.py, validate.py, recover.py docstrings/help text; README.md (12 fixes); getting-started.md (10 fixes); cli-reference.md (11 fixes). ~35 total fixes across 6 files. (priority: P2) [source: F-153, F-460, fresh-eyes audit]
- [x] [Lens] Add hints to 8 hintless output_error() calls + fix raw console.print error in clear validation. Layer 2 completion: every output_error in the CLI now has actionable hints. 10 TDD tests in test_hintless_error_audit.py. Quality gate baseline 1440→1455. Commit d286e07.

Codex M1 (current cycle): added spec corpus + grounding hooks sections to score-writing-guide, 4 missing CLI commands (init, cancel, clear, top) + --profile option to cli-reference, conductor clones section to daemon-guide, fixed example count in index.md. Guide M1C4: fixed getting-started.md hello.yaml output reference (HTML not md), added instrument_name to template variables reference, added 2 Rosetta proof scores + 7 creative examples to README Beyond Coding section, F-126 resolved. Codex M2: added instrument migration guide section to score-writing-guide (field mapping table, before/after examples, compatibility notes). Fixed stale -w flag on status example. Fixed V009 severity in CLI reference (ERROR not WARNING). Mateship pickup of unnamed musician's CLI reference updates (V-code expansion, init positional arg, list --json, instrument syntax) and daemon guide baton section. Updated limitations.md (baton, instruments, runner mixin). Codex M3: documented 6 new M3 features across 5 docs: clear-rate-limits command (CLI reference), stop safety guard (CLI reference), stagger_delay_ms (score-writing guide + configuration-reference), rate limit auto-resume + prompt assembly (daemon guide), instrument column in status (CLI reference), restart --profile/--pid-file options (CLI reference).

Session 2 — 6 deliverables: baton transition plan (P0 composer directive), IPC table daemon.clear_rate_limits, preflight config (daemon guide + config reference), use_baton in config reference, limitations baton cross-reference, getting-started.md verified. Remaining: none — all M4 features documented.
- [x] [Guide] Update score-authoring skill: fix 4 incorrect values, add per-sheet overrides + fan-out aliases + non-Claude backends + instrument/spec sections. Keep it tight — authoring guide, not config reference. (priority: P1) [source: F-078] — Fixed max_output_capture_bytes (10KB→50KB), added recursive_light to backend types, added instrument_name to core vars, added fan-out aliases (movement/voice/voice_count/total_movements), added Instrument section (recommended) + per-sheet instruments section. Commit 3fc7fcd (plugins submodule e5facf2).
- [ ] Audit and clean examples/ — remove or update outdated scores, ensure all use current patterns and features. Fix any docs that reference renamed/moved/superseded scores. (priority: P0) [source: composer notes — docs as UX] — Guide M2: migrated all 7 remaining backend: examples to instrument:, updated examples/README.md with 15 missing entries, filed F-088 (4 examples with hardcoded absolute paths need cleanup or move to scores-internal/). Guide M1C4: full audit — all 36 scores use instrument: at config level (instrument migration COMPLETE), 35/36 pass validation (only iterative-dev-loop-config.yaml fails — generator config not a score, F-125). Added 2 Rosetta proof scores to README, fixed iterative-dev-loop-config entry. Newcomer M2C2: fixed F-140 — broken Rosetta references in README.md and examples/README.md, added all 4 proof scores (was 2), fixed echelon-repair.yaml internal ref. Compass M2C2: fixed score-composer.yaml V108 (broken prelude path skills/→plugins/) + stale backend terminology (target_backend→target_instrument). Fixed limitations.md backend: workaround→instrument_config:. Full validation sweep: 38/39 pass (only iterative-dev-loop-config.yaml expected). All 4 rosetta scores pass. Zero hardcoded absolute paths remain. Remaining: pattern modernization (fan-out aliases, per-sheet overrides in appropriate examples).
- [x] [Codex] Document all undocumented score features (grounding hooks, per-sheet overrides, spec corpus, instrument config, etc.) before using them in examples. No guessing. (priority: P0) [source: composer notes — understand before using] — Added spec corpus section (spec_dir, include_claude_md, spec_tags per-sheet filtering) and grounding hooks section (enabled, fail_on_grounding_failure, escalate_on_failure, hooks) to score-writing-guide.md. Per-sheet overrides and instrument config already documented by Guide M2 and Blueprint M3.
- [x] [Spark] Adapt Rosetta proof score (immune-cascade) and 2-3 other corpus patterns into clean public examples in examples/. Use named patterns from the corpus, clean paths, good comments. (priority: P1) [source: F-079 / composer notes] — Created 2 new Rosetta pattern examples: examples/rosetta/source-triangulation.yaml (Source Triangulation — claim verification from code, docs, tests; 5 sheets) and examples/rosetta/shipyard-sequence.yaml (Shipyard Sequence — build with validation gate; 7 sheets). Both validate clean, use movements: key, proper workspace paths. Updated examples/README.md with new entries. Total Rosetta examples: 6 (was 4).
- [x] [Spark] Update the Rosetta Score's primitives list and proof criteria to reflect current Mozart capabilities (instruments, spec corpus, grounding, new features). (priority: P1) [source: composer notes — Rosetta as capability factory] — Updated scores/the-rosetta-score.yaml: primitives section now includes movements: YAML key, stagger_delay_ms, skip_when, fan-in skipped_upstream, cross_sheet config, grounding hooks, per-sheet instrument assignment, instrument_map, instrument_config.model, spec corpus injection. Existing vocabulary updated with corpus size (56 patterns), recent additions (iteration 4), awaiting primitives, new capabilities list, and 10 practiced patterns (was 6). Validates clean.
- [x] [Spark, Guide] Audit existing examples/ scores against updated score-authoring skill — upgrade to use new features (fan-out aliases, per-sheet overrides, instrument terminology) where they make better examples. (priority: P2) [source: F-079 / composer notes] — Spark M2: modernized dialectic.yaml and parallel-research-fanout.yaml. Spark M3: modernized 7 more fan-out examples with movements: key, movement/voice terminology in comments and template text, added parallel: enabled where missing. Updated: worldbuilder.yaml, thinking-lab.yaml, dinner-party.yaml, design-review.yaml, skill-builder.yaml, palimpsest.yaml, score-composer.yaml. Fixed V207 warnings (fan-out without parallel) in worldbuilder and palimpsest. Guide M3: completed remaining 10 scores with movements: declarations — hello.yaml, 4 Rosetta proofs (immune-cascade, dead-letter-quarantine, prefabrication, echelon-repair), context-engineering-lab, issue-solver, quality-continuous, quality-continuous-generic, quality-daemon. Total: 19/19 multi-stage examples now have movements: declarations. All 37 scores validate clean.

Spark M4: created 4th demo (invoice-analysis.yaml — 3-voice parallel analysis: financial accuracy, compliance, anomaly detection; 5 sheets, 7 validations). All 4 validate clean. D-023 COMPLETE.
- [x] [Blueprint] F-116: Add V210 instrument name validation to `mozart validate` (priority: P2) [source: F-116, Journey M1C3] — InstrumentNameCheck warns on unknown instrument names. Checks score-level, per-sheet, instrument_map, movements. 15 TDD tests. Commit 327e536.
- [x] [Blueprint] F-127: Fix `_classify_success_outcome` to use cumulative `attempt_count` instead of session-local `normal_attempts` (priority: P2) [source: F-127, Ember M1C3] — Uses SheetState.attempt_count (persisted) instead of session-local counter. 7 TDD tests. Commit 327e536.
- [x] [Blueprint, Maverick] Fix `build_clone_config()` missing `state_db_path` + `log_file` overrides (priority: P1) [source: F-132] — Maverick fixed both branches in b4146a7. Blueprint added 5 clone isolation tests in 327e536.

### Timeout & Stale Detection (F-097, F-102)
- [x] [Bedrock] Increase `idle_timeout_seconds` from 1800 to 7200 in `generate-v3.py` (priority: P0) [source: F-097, F-102] — Verified: already updated by composer. `generate-v3.py:443` shows `idle_timeout_seconds: 7200`. D-025 verified.
- [x] [Bedrock] Regenerate `mozart-orchestra-v3.yaml` with updated timeouts (priority: P0) [source: F-097] — Verified: score line 3963 shows `idle_timeout_seconds: 7200`. Score is consistent with generator.
- [x] [Blueprint] Add distinct error code E006 for stale detection (differentiate from backend timeout E001) (priority: P1) [source: F-097] — E006 EXECUTION_STALE added to ErrorCode enum, RetryBehavior (120s delay), WARNING severity. Classifier differentiates stale from timeout via "stale execution" in stderr. Both classify() and classify_execution() paths handled. 10 TDD tests.
- [x] [Spark] Fix error display: stale detection shows `Code: timeout` instead of error code (priority: P1) [source: F-097] — Added `error_code` field to SheetState, wired through `mark_sheet_failed()` and runner failure handlers. Added `format_error_code_for_display()` in output.py that maps ErrorCategory values to canonical error codes when structured error_code is None. Updated status.py, diagnose.py, and format_error_details. 26 TDD tests.

### Rate Limit Classification (F-098, F-099)
- [x] [Blueprint] Update error classifier to detect rate limit patterns in stdout, not just stderr (priority: P0) [source: F-098] — Added Phase 4.5 "Rate Limit Override" to classify_execution() that always scans stdout+stderr for rate limit patterns, even when Phase 1 found structured JSON errors. Patterns "rate.?limit", "hit.{0,10}limit", "limit.{0,10}resets?" already existed but were unreachable when Phase 1 masked them. 6 TDD tests including the core F-098 regression case.
- [x] [Blueprint] Add patterns: "API Error: Rate limit reached", "You've hit your limit", "resets" (priority: P0) [source: F-098] — Patterns already existed in _DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_PATTERNS. The bug was Phase 4 being skipped when Phase 1 found JSON errors. Phase 4.5 override fixes this.
- [x] [Forge] Stagger fan-out launches (100ms delay between starts) to reduce rate limit surge (priority: P2) [source: F-099] — Implemented as stagger_delay_ms on ParallelConfig. See M5 entry for details.

### Rate Limit Auto-Resume (F-112)
- [x] [Circuit] Schedule RateLimitExpired timer on rate limit hit — auto-resumes WAITING sheets when limit clears (priority: P1) [source: F-112] — Added timer scheduling in `_handle_rate_limit_hit()` at `core.py:958-967`. 10 TDD tests in `test_rate_limit_auto_resume.py`. The event type and handler already existed but nothing triggered them.

### Rate Limit Backpressure UX (F-110)
- [x] [Lens] Accept jobs in PENDING state during rate limit backpressure instead of rejecting (priority: P1) [source: F-110] — Mateship pickup of unnamed musician's implementation. BackpressureController.rejection_reason() distinguishes rate-limit vs resource pressure. JobManager._queue_pending_job() registers with PENDING status in JobMeta (visible in list/status). JobResponse model gains "pending" literal. DaemonJobStatus.PENDING added. CLI _handle_pending_response() shows info not error. Lens fixes: wired _start_pending_jobs() into clear_rate_limits() + deferred auto-start timer, added JobMeta tracking for list visibility, fixed mypy lambda inference. 23 TDD tests in test_rate_limit_pending.py. Fixed 3 existing tests in test_clear_rate_limits.py and 6 in test_m3_pass4_adversarial_breakpoint.py. Docs updated (cli-reference, daemon-guide).
- [x] [Lens] Pending jobs start automatically when rate limit clears (priority: P1) [source: F-110] — _start_pending_jobs() called after clear_rate_limits() (manual) + scheduled via deferred asyncio task with rate limit expiry delay + 2s buffer (automatic). Jobs started in FIFO order, backpressure re-checked between each.
- [x] [Lens] Pending jobs can be cancelled via `mozart cancel` (priority: P1) [source: F-110] — cancel_job() checks _pending_jobs first, removes from queue, updates JobMeta to CANCELLED, runs cleanup task. Included in mateship pickup implementation.
- [x] [Dash] `mozart run` / `mozart resume` shows time remaining when rate-limited: "Rate limit on claude-cli — clears in Xm Ys" (priority: P1) [source: F-110] — format_rate_limit_info() in output.py, query_rate_limits() in helpers.py, _show_rate_limits_on_rejection() in run.py, _show_active_rate_limits_sync() in status.py. Also enhanced _rejection_hints() with fresh-aware "clear stale entry" hints and updated pressure hints to suggest clear-rate-limits. 18 TDD tests.
- [x] [Lens] Fix misleading "Mozart conductor is not running" error on backpressure rejection (priority: P1) [source: F-110] — _try_daemon_submit now raises typer.Exit(1) on explicit rejection instead of returning False (which triggered misleading "not running" fallback). Rejection reason shown with hints. 3 TDD tests.

### Multi-Instrument Support (F-100, F-101, F-103, F-104, F-105)
- [x] [Composer] Fix baton `config.backend.max_retries` → `config.retry.max_retries` (priority: P0) [source: F-103]
- [x] [Composer] Add DispatchRetry kick after job registration (priority: P0) [source: F-103]
- [x] [Composer] Wire BackendPool creation + injection in manager startup (priority: P0) [source: F-103]
- [x] [Forge] Wire prompt rendering pipeline into baton musician `_build_prompt()` (priority: P0) [source: F-104] — Rewrote `_build_prompt()` with full 5-layer assembly: preamble (build_preamble), Jinja2 template rendering (Sheet.template_variables()), prelude/cadenza injection resolution, validation requirements formatting, completion mode suffix. Added `_render_template()`, `_resolve_injections()`, `_format_injection_section()`, `_format_validation_requirements()`. Updated `sheet_task()` with `total_sheets`/`total_movements` params. Adapter computes totals from registered sheets. 17 TDD tests. **UNBLOCKS BATON EXECUTION.**
- [x] [Canyon, Foundation] Wire cross-sheet context (previous_outputs/previous_files) into baton dispatch path (priority: P0) [source: F-210, Weaver M3] — Canyon M4: TDD tests (21), AttemptContext.previous_files, adapter._job_cross_sheet + _collect_cross_sheet_context() + _dispatch_callback wiring. Foundation M4 mateship: PromptRenderer._build_context() accepts AttemptContext to populate SheetContext cross-sheet fields, manager passes config.cross_sheet to register_job/recover_job, test fixes (CheckpointState/SheetAttemptResult constructors). F-210 RESOLVED.
- [x] [Canyon, Foundation] Fix baton checkpoint sync for EscalationResolved/EscalationTimeout/CancelJob/ShutdownRequested/JobTimeout/RateLimitExpired (priority: P2) [source: F-211, Weaver M3] — Canyon M4: TDD tests (16+18), state-diff architecture, _capture_pre_event_state, duck-typed single-sheet sync, CancelJob/ShutdownRequested handlers. Foundation M4: state-diff dedup cache (_synced_status), JobTimeout handler (_sync_all_sheets_for_job), RateLimitExpired handler (_sync_all_sheets_for_instrument), fixed _sync_cancelled_sheets_from_state to use dedup, fixed pre-existing test failures in test_baton_restart_recovery.py. F-211 RESOLVED.
- [x] [Canyon] Enable `use_baton: true` in conductor config after F-210 fixed (priority: P1) [source: F-100, F-210] — D-027: Flipped `use_baton` default to `True` in DaemonConfig. Gate prerequisites: F-271 (MCP disable, Canyon mateship) and F-255.2 (live_states, Foundation+Canyon mateship) resolved. Legacy tests updated with `use_baton=False`. 3 TDD tests in test_d027_baton_default.py.
- [ ] Route claude-cli through PluginCliBackend (not native ClaudeCliBackend) (priority: P1) [source: F-105]
- [x] [Blueprint] Expand instrument YAML schema: timeout/crash/capacity/stale patterns (priority: P1) [source: F-105] — Added crash_patterns and stale_patterns to CliErrorConfig (timeout_patterns and capacity_patterns already existed). 6 TDD tests. Log capture rules deferred.
- [x] [Spark] Verify `PluginCliBackend._classify_error()` uses profile-defined error patterns (priority: P1) [source: F-101] — Verified: _check_rate_limit() uses rate_limit_patterns, _classify_output_errors() uses auth_error_patterns/crash_patterns/stale_patterns/timeout_patterns/capacity_patterns. All from profile. 22 existing tests in test_plugin_cli_backend.py cover this.
- [ ] Add gemini-cli rate limit test: submit a sheet, mock rate limit response, verify E101/E102 classification (priority: P2) [source: F-101]

### Finding ID System (D-018)
- [x] [Bedrock] Design and implement finding ID collision prevention (priority: P2) [source: D-018, F-148] — Range-based allocation: `FINDING_RANGES.md` pre-allocates 10 IDs per musician per movement (M4: F-160 through F-479). Helper script `scripts/next-finding-id.sh` as fallback. FINDINGS.md header updated with protocol. Historical collision table documents 12 ambiguous IDs. F-148 RESOLVED.

### Rate Limit Wait Cap (F-350)
- [x] [Bedrock] Mateship pickup: commit uncommitted rate limit wait cap safety fix (priority: P2) [source: F-350, uncommitted work] — `RESET_TIME_MAXIMUM_WAIT_SECONDS = 86400.0` in constants.py, `_clamp_wait()` in classifier.py, quality gate baseline 1230→1234, 10 TDD tests in test_rate_limit_wait_cap.py. Prevents adversarial API responses from blocking instruments forever.

### Cost Accuracy Investigation (D-024)
- [x] [Circuit] D-024 cost accuracy investigation — trace full pipeline, identify 5 root causes (priority: P1) [source: D-024, North directive] — F-180 filed. Root causes: ClaudeCliBackend zero tokens, baton hardcoded pricing, instrument profile pricing unused, confidence not displayed, text output format default. Commit 4055f0b.
- [x] [Circuit] Fix ClaudeCliBackend token extraction from JSON output (priority: P1) [source: F-180] — `_extract_tokens_from_json()` parses `usage.input_tokens`/`output_tokens` from Claude Code JSON response. 10 TDD tests. Commit 4055f0b.
- [x] [Circuit] Add cost confidence display to `mozart status` (priority: P1) [source: F-180] — `_render_cost_summary()` shows `~$X.XX (est.)` with warning for low-confidence costs. JSON output includes `cost_confidence` field. 2 TDD tests. Commit 4055f0b.
- [ ] Wire instrument profile model pricing into both cost paths (priority: P2) [source: F-180 root cause 3]
- [ ] Fix baton `_estimate_cost()` to use instrument profile pricing (priority: P2) [source: F-180 root cause 2]

### Skill Rename: mozart:usage → mozart:operations (or similar)
- [x] [Dash] Rename `mozart:usage` skill to `mozart:command` — collides with built-in `/usage` (Claude token usage). (priority: P1) [source: composer directive] — Renamed skills/usage/ → skills/command/ in plugin submodule, updated SKILL.md frontmatter + title, updated cross-references in score-authoring/SKILL.md (3 refs) and essentials.md (1 ref). Updated project CLAUDE.md (2 refs from stale absolute paths to plugin skill invocations). Global CLAUDE.md needs manual update (permission denied from agent context).
- [x] [Dash] Update all references across project: CLAUDE.md, skill files, docs (priority: P1) — Completed as part of rename above.

### Gemini CLI Agent Assignment (TDF Analysis — Composer Recommendation)
- [ ] Assign gemini-cli instrument to dreamer agents (6 per movement) — memory consolidation, low tool use (priority: P1) [source: composer TDF analysis]
- [ ] Assign gemini-cli instrument to reviewer agents (prism, axiom, ember) — read-heavy analysis, low tool use (priority: P2) [source: composer TDF analysis]
- [ ] Keep claude-cli for: setup (canyon, bedrock), work (all 32 musicians), quality-gate (bedrock), antagonists (newcomer, adversary) (priority: P1) [source: composer TDF analysis]
- [ ] Add `instrument_map` or `per_sheet_instruments` to `generate-v3.py` for gemini-cli assignments (priority: P1) [source: composer TDF analysis]

## Validation Strictness + Missing Score Features

### Unknown YAML Field Rejection (CRITICAL)
- [x] [Journey, Axiom] Set `extra='forbid'` on JobConfig, SheetConfig, and all nested config models — unknown YAML fields must ERROR, not silently pass (priority: P0) [source: composer directive, 2026-04-04] — Journey: job.py models + backward compat for total_sheets + schema error hints. Axiom mateship: remaining 45 models across 7 config modules + test fixes + dashboard E2E fix. All 51 config models verified. F-441 RESOLVED.
- [x] [Journey] Add V212 validation check: detect YAML keys not in schema and report them with "did you mean X?" suggestions (priority: P1) [source: composer directive] — _unknown_field_hints() in validate.py with _KNOWN_TYPOS dictionary (11 common typos). 16 user journey tests.

### Loops / Iteration Primitives
- [ ] Design and implement score-level loop primitives — `for_each`, `repeat_until`, or similar (priority: P1) [source: MEMORY.md "Score logic beyond Jinja"] — Currently scores can only loop via self-chaining. Loops should be a first-class YAML primitive for iterative patterns (Fixed-Point Iteration, Cathedral Construction, CDCL Search).

### User Variables in Validations
- [x] [Maverick] Expand validation variable support to include user-defined `prompt.variables` (priority: P1) [source: composer directive, 2026-04-04] — Merged prompt.variables into path_context in rendering.py (preview/validate) and recover.py (recover command). User vars are base layer, built-in vars override. Legacy runner (sheet.py:408) and baton (musician.py via Sheet.template_variables()) already included user vars. 8 TDD tests in test_user_variables_in_validations.py.

Records from/to/reason/timestamp. Survives JSON serialization roundtrip. 4 TDD tests.
- [x] [Harper] Add V211 validation: warn on unknown fallback instrument names (priority: P1) [source: instrument fallbacks spec] — InstrumentFallbackCheck class in validation/checks/config.py. Checks score-level, movement-level, and per-sheet fallback names against loaded profiles + score aliases. WARNING severity (same as V210). Registered in runner.py. 8 TDD tests.
- [ ] Add fallback indicator to `mozart status` display (priority: P1) [source: instrument fallbacks spec]
- [ ] INFO-level logging for all fallback events (priority: P1) [source: instrument fallbacks spec]
- [ ] TDD tests: config parsing, resolution chain, baton dispatch, fan-out inheritance, checkpoint persistence (priority: P0) [source: instrument fallbacks spec]
- [ ] Adversarial tests: empty chain, circular refs, all fallbacks exhausted, rate limit vs unavailable distinction (priority: P1) [source: instrument fallbacks spec]

## Blind Spot Fixes (Prism M4 Pass 2)

- [x] [Prism] Fix quality gate drift: bare MagicMock in test_top_error_ux.py → spec'd mocks (priority: P2) [source: quality gate failure]
- [x] [Prism] Fix Rosetta score instrument_fallbacks field that fails extra='forbid' (priority: P1) [source: F-441 side effect]
- [x] [Maverick] Fix F-431: Add extra='forbid' to DaemonConfig, ProfilerConfig, and all daemon config models (priority: P2) [source: F-431, Prism M4] — Added ConfigDict(extra="forbid") to all 9 models: 5 in daemon/config.py (ResourceLimitConfig, SocketConfig, ObserverConfig, SemanticLearningConfig, DaemonConfig), 4 in profiler/models.py (RetentionConfig, AnomalyConfig, CorrelationConfig, ProfilerConfig). 23 TDD tests.
