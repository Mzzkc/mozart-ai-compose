## CRITICAL: --conductor-clone (BLOCKS ALL TESTING)

This is the highest priority task. You are running inside a live conductor. You cannot test against it.

- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Implement --conductor-clone as a global CLI option (priority: P0) [source: composer directive, movement 1] — Spark: mateship pickup of unnamed musician's clone.py + detect.py + cli/__init__.py. Added clone_name param to start_conductor in process.py, wired start/restart/conductor-status with clone paths. 28 TDD tests.
- [x] [Ghost] Full accounting of ALL mozart CLI commands — which ones interact with the daemon? (priority: P0) — Audit at movement-2/cli-daemon-audit.md: 20 commands, 14 interact with daemon, 10 IPC methods, 3 direct DaemonClient sites, implementation recommendations
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Each daemon-interacting command gains --conductor-clone support (priority: P0) — IPC commands route via _resolve_socket_path() clone override. Lifecycle commands (start/stop/restart/conductor-status) wired with clone PID/socket/config overrides.
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Clone conductor uses isolated socket (/tmp/mozart-clone.sock), PID (/tmp/mozart-clone.pid), state DB, logs (priority: P0) — resolve_clone_paths() + build_clone_config(). start_conductor() applies clone path overrides to loaded config.
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Clone inherits production daemon config unless overridden (priority: P0) — _load_config() runs normally, then clone paths applied on top via model_dump/model_validate.
- [x] [Spark, unnamed musician] Support named clones: --conductor-clone=name (priority: P1) — _sanitize_name() ensures safe file paths. Named clones produce unique paths: /tmp/mozart-clone-{name}.sock etc.
- [x] [Harper] Harden clone name sanitization: long name truncation (64 char cap), fix TYPE_CHECKING type signatures (object→DaemonConfig). 26 TDD tests in test_conductor_clone_hardening.py covering adversarial inputs, config inheritance, path isolation, built-in profile validation. (priority: P1) [source: mateship review of Spark's clone implementation]
- [ ] Convert ALL pytests that touch the daemon to use --conductor-clone or appropriate mocking (priority: P0)
- [ ] Audit CLI UX during the full command accounting — document improvement opportunities (priority: P1)
- [ ] Update CLI reference docs to document --conductor-clone (priority: P1)

Guide M2: added instrument_config section to score-writing-guide.md, migrated score-writing-guide code samples to instrument: syntax, updated examples/README.md with 15 missing examples. Remaining: instrument migration guide, full docs review pass.
- [ ] Update score-authoring skill: fix 4 incorrect values, add per-sheet overrides + fan-out aliases + non-Claude backends + instrument/spec sections. Keep it tight — authoring guide, not config reference. (priority: P1) [source: F-078]
- [ ] Audit and clean examples/ — remove or update outdated scores, ensure all use current patterns and features. Fix any docs that reference renamed/moved/superseded scores. (priority: P0) [source: composer notes — docs as UX] — Guide M2: migrated all 7 remaining backend: examples to instrument:, updated examples/README.md with 15 missing entries, filed F-088 (4 examples with hardcoded absolute paths need cleanup or move to scores-internal/). Full audit still needed: path cleanup, pattern modernization.

## Composer-Assigned Tasking (Post-Mortem — v3 Failure Investigation)

These tasks were identified by the composer during failure investigation of the v3 job.
See FINDINGS.md F-097 through F-102 for full context.

### Timeout & Stale Detection (F-097, F-102)
- [ ] Increase `idle_timeout_seconds` from 1800 to 7200 in `generate-v3.py` (priority: P0) [source: F-097, F-102]
- [ ] Regenerate `mozart-orchestra-v3.yaml` with updated timeouts (priority: P0) [source: F-097]
- [x] [Blueprint] Add distinct error code E006 for stale detection (differentiate from backend timeout E001) (priority: P1) [source: F-097] — E006 EXECUTION_STALE added to ErrorCode enum, RetryBehavior (120s delay), WARNING severity. Classifier differentiates stale from timeout via "stale execution" in stderr. Both classify() and classify_execution() paths handled. 10 TDD tests.
- [x] [Spark] Fix error display: stale detection shows `Code: timeout` instead of error code (priority: P1) [source: F-097] — Added `error_code` field to SheetState, wired through `mark_sheet_failed()` and runner failure handlers. Added `format_error_code_for_display()` in output.py that maps ErrorCategory values to canonical error codes when structured error_code is None. Updated status.py, diagnose.py, and format_error_details. 26 TDD tests.

### Rate Limit Classification (F-098, F-099)
- [x] [Blueprint] Update error classifier to detect rate limit patterns in stdout, not just stderr (priority: P0) [source: F-098] — Added Phase 4.5 "Rate Limit Override" to classify_execution() that always scans stdout+stderr for rate limit patterns, even when Phase 1 found structured JSON errors. Patterns "rate.?limit", "hit.{0,10}limit", "limit.{0,10}resets?" already existed but were unreachable when Phase 1 masked them. 6 TDD tests including the core F-098 regression case.
- [x] [Blueprint] Add patterns: "API Error: Rate limit reached", "You've hit your limit", "resets" (priority: P0) [source: F-098] — Patterns already existed in _DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_PATTERNS. The bug was Phase 4 being skipped when Phase 1 found JSON errors. Phase 4.5 override fixes this.
- [ ] Consider staggering fan-out launches (100ms delay between starts) to reduce rate limit surge (priority: P2) [source: F-099]

### Rate Limit Backpressure UX (F-110)
- [ ] Accept jobs in PENDING state during rate limit backpressure instead of rejecting (priority: P1) [source: F-110]
- [ ] Pending jobs start automatically when rate limit clears (priority: P1) [source: F-110]
- [ ] Pending jobs can be cancelled via `mozart cancel` (priority: P1) [source: F-110]
- [ ] `mozart run` / `mozart resume` shows time remaining when rate-limited: "Rate limit on claude-cli — clears in Xm Ys" (priority: P1) [source: F-110]
- [ ] Fix misleading "Mozart conductor is not running" error on backpressure rejection (priority: P1) [source: F-110]

### Multi-Instrument Support (F-100, F-101, F-103, F-104, F-105)
- [x] [Composer] Fix baton `config.backend.max_retries` → `config.retry.max_retries` (priority: P0) [source: F-103]
- [x] [Composer] Add DispatchRetry kick after job registration (priority: P0) [source: F-103]
- [x] [Composer] Wire BackendPool creation + injection in manager startup (priority: P0) [source: F-103]
- [x] [Forge] Wire prompt rendering pipeline into baton musician `_build_prompt()` (priority: P0) [source: F-104] — Rewrote `_build_prompt()` with full 5-layer assembly: preamble (build_preamble), Jinja2 template rendering (Sheet.template_variables()), prelude/cadenza injection resolution, validation requirements formatting, completion mode suffix. Added `_render_template()`, `_resolve_injections()`, `_format_injection_section()`, `_format_validation_requirements()`. Updated `sheet_task()` with `total_sheets`/`total_movements` params. Adapter computes totals from registered sheets. 17 TDD tests. **UNBLOCKS BATON EXECUTION.**
- [ ] Enable `use_baton: true` in conductor config after F-104 (priority: P1) [source: F-100]
- [ ] Route claude-cli through PluginCliBackend (not native ClaudeCliBackend) (priority: P1) [source: F-105]
- [x] [Blueprint] Expand instrument YAML schema: timeout/crash/capacity/stale patterns (priority: P1) [source: F-105] — Added crash_patterns and stale_patterns to CliErrorConfig (timeout_patterns and capacity_patterns already existed). 6 TDD tests. Log capture rules deferred.
- [x] [Spark] Verify `PluginCliBackend._classify_error()` uses profile-defined error patterns (priority: P1) [source: F-101] — Verified: _check_rate_limit() uses rate_limit_patterns, _classify_output_errors() uses auth_error_patterns/crash_patterns/stale_patterns/timeout_patterns/capacity_patterns. All from profile. 22 existing tests in test_plugin_cli_backend.py cover this.
- [ ] Add gemini-cli rate limit test: submit a sheet, mock rate limit response, verify E101/E102 classification (priority: P2) [source: F-101]

### Skill Rename: mozart:usage → mozart:operations (or similar)
- [ ] Rename `mozart:usage` skill to `mozart:command` — collides with built-in `/usage` (Claude token usage). Every user who types `/usage` gets Mozart debugging help instead of their token count. (priority: P1) [source: composer directive]
- [ ] Update all references across project: CLAUDE.md, skill files, memory-bank, docs, score comments, session protocols (priority: P1)

### Gemini CLI Agent Assignment (TDF Analysis — Composer Recommendation)
- [ ] Assign gemini-cli instrument to dreamer agents (6 per movement) — memory consolidation, low tool use (priority: P1) [source: composer TDF analysis]
- [ ] Assign gemini-cli instrument to reviewer agents (prism, axiom, ember) — read-heavy analysis, low tool use (priority: P2) [source: composer TDF analysis]
- [ ] Keep claude-cli for: setup (canyon, bedrock), work (all 32 musicians), quality-gate (bedrock), antagonists (newcomer, adversary) (priority: P1) [source: composer TDF analysis]
- [ ] Add `instrument_map` or `per_sheet_instruments` to `generate-v3.py` for gemini-cli assignments (priority: P1) [source: composer TDF analysis]
