## Executive Summary

Movement 3 produced 25 commits from 16+ musicians. Quality gates are GREEN: mypy clean, ruff clean. The three critical baton fixes (F-152, F-145, F-158) are verified correct on HEAD.

I found and fixed **F-440 (P1)**: a state sync gap that resurrects the zombie job pattern from F-039. The `_sync_sheet_status()` callback only fires for `SheetAttemptResult` and `SheetSkipped` events, but `_propagate_failure_to_dependents()` directly modifies sheet status without generating events. On restart recovery, cascaded failures are lost — dependents revert to PENDING with a FAILED upstream → zombie job. Fixed by re-running failure propagation during `register_job()`. 8 TDD tests.

This is the third movement where I've found bugs at system boundaries — two correct subsystems composing into incorrect behavior.

## F-440: Zombie Resurrection via State Sync Gap (FOUND AND FIXED)

### The Trace

I read the code backwards from `is_job_complete()` to find what could prevent job completion after recovery.

1. `is_job_complete()` at `core.py:587-595` requires ALL sheets in `_TERMINAL_BATON_STATUSES`
2. `_SATISFIED_BATON_STATUSES` at `state.py:82-85` = {COMPLETED, SKIPPED} — FAILED is NOT satisfied
3. `_is_dependency_satisfied()` at `core.py:628-638` checks dep status against `_SATISFIED_BATON_STATUSES`
4. **Key observation:** If a dependent sheet is PENDING and its upstream is FAILED, the dependent can never be dispatched (dependency not satisfied) and is not terminal → zombie

5. During runtime: `_propagate_failure_to_dependents()` at `core.py:1218-1271` cascades FAILED to dependents — correct
6. During state sync: `_sync_sheet_status()` at `adapter.py:1109-1148` only fires for `isinstance(event, (SheetAttemptResult, SheetSkipped))` — other events' status changes not synced
7. `_propagate_failure_to_dependents()` modifies status directly (core.py:1260) without generating events — cascaded failures are invisible to the sync callback

**Proof of bug:** Sheet 1 fails → dependents (sheets 5, 10, 15) cascaded to FAILED in memory. Only sheet 1's failure synced to checkpoint. Restart → checkpoint says sheets 5, 10, 15 are PENDING. Recovery registers PENDING dependents with FAILED upstream. Dependents stuck forever → `is_job_complete()` returns False → zombie.

### The Fix

Added failure re-propagation to `BatonCore.register_job()` at `core.py:546-556`:

```python
for sheet_num, sheet in sheets.items():
    if sheet.status == BatonSheetStatus.FAILED:
        self._propagate_failure_to_dependents(job_id, sheet_num)
```

This is idempotent — `_propagate_failure_to_dependents` only affects non-terminal sheets. For fresh jobs (all PENDING), the loop body never executes. For recovery (some FAILED), it cascades correctly.

### Tests

8 TDD tests in `tests/test_recovery_failure_propagation.py`:
- Direct dependency propagation on recovery
- Transitive chain propagation (1→2→3)
- Terminal dependents not affected (COMPLETED stays COMPLETED)
- No propagation when no failures
- Multiple independent failure chains
- Diamond dependency pattern
- `is_job_complete()` returns True after propagation (anti-zombie)
- Adapter-level `recover_job()` integration test

Updated 2 tests in `tests/test_baton_m2c2_adversarial.py` that were asserting the buggy behavior (PENDING instead of FAILED for dependents of FAILED sheets).

### Error Class

Same class as F-065: two correct subsystems composing into incorrect behavior at their boundary. The baton's in-memory state (correct) and the checkpoint system (correct) diverge because the sync bridge (adapter) doesn't cover direct state mutations. The fix closes the gap by re-running the mutation after registration.

### Additional Sync Gaps (P2, not fixed this movement)

`_sync_sheet_status` also doesn't fire for:
- `EscalationResolved/EscalationTimeout` → terminal transitions not synced
- `CancelJob/ShutdownRequested` → CANCELLED transitions not synced
- `ProcessExited` → failure transitions not synced

These are lower impact: escalation+restart is rare, cancel/shutdown are at the baton's lifetime boundary, and ProcessExited recovers naturally. Filed as P2 detail in F-440.

## M3 Fix Verification

### F-152 (P0): Dispatch Guard — VERIFIED ON HEAD

`_send_dispatch_failure()` at `adapter.py:746-792` sends E505 `SheetAttemptResult` on dispatch failure. Called from all 3 early-return paths in `_dispatch_callback`:
1. Sheet not found (adapter.py:822)
2. No backend pool (adapter.py:835)
3. Exception on backend acquire (adapter.py:866)

Exception catch is `Exception` (broad) — correct, since `NotImplementedError` was the original F-152 root cause.

### F-145 (P2): Concert Chaining — VERIFIED ON HEAD

`has_completed_sheets()` at `adapter.py:674` checked at both `_run_via_baton` (manager.py:1837) and `_resume_via_baton` (manager.py:1968). `completed_new_work` flag correctly set.

### F-158 (P1): Prompt Assembly — VERIFIED ON HEAD

`prompt_config=config.prompt` and `parallel_enabled=config.parallel.enabled` passed to both `register_job()` (manager.py:1815-1816) and `recover_job()` (manager.py:1959-1960). `PromptRenderer` created at `adapter.py:419-430` and used at `adapter.py:953-960`.

### F-200 (P2): Rate Limit Clear Fallthrough — VERIFIED ON HEAD

`clear_instrument_rate_limit()` at `core.py:254-297` uses `.get()` with `is not None` guard. Both F-200 (unknown name) and F-201 (empty string) fixed.

### F-112 (P1): Rate Limit Auto-Resume — VERIFIED ON HEAD

Timer scheduled at `core.py:965-967` via `RateLimitExpired` event. Handler at `core.py:991-1020` clears instrument rate limit and moves WAITING sheets back to PENDING.

## Assessment

The baton is architecturally sound. After three movements of invariant analysis, the bugs get progressively harder to find — they're at system boundaries, in sync paths, in recovery flows. F-440 was hiding in the gap between the baton's event-driven model and the checkpoint's callback-driven sync. The event bridge (adapter) covered the common path but not the direct-mutation path.

The remaining P2 sync gaps (escalation, cancel, process exit) are real but lower priority. The critical gap — failure propagation — is now closed. With F-152 (dispatch guard) and F-440 (recovery propagation) both fixed, the baton's zombie job defense is complete across both the runtime and recovery paths.

The baton is ready for Phase 1 testing with `--conductor-clone`.
