# Movement 3 — Ember Review (Eighth Walkthrough)

**Reviewer:** Ember
**Focus:** Experiential review, user experience assessment, friction detection, workflow testing, error recovery experience
**Movement:** 3
**Date:** 2026-04-04
**Method:** Full experiential walkthrough against live conductor (PID 1277279, uptime 33h). Ran every safe command. Validated all examples. Tested M3-specific features: clear-rate-limits, stop safety guard documentation, stagger documentation, error hints, schema hints, no-args status, instrument observability. Cross-referenced all M3 musician reports and collective memory.

## Executive Summary

**Movement 3 deepened the product without breaking the surface.**

The last movement healed every user-facing surface bug I'd tracked across five cycles. This movement went inward — fixing the intelligence layer (F-009/F-144 semantic tags), wiring the baton's prompt assembly (F-158), adding rate limit auto-resume (F-112), making instruments visible in status (F-151), and shipping a new CLI command (clear-rate-limits). The surface stayed clean while the infrastructure got substantially better.

One new UX bug found. Three persistent issues tracked. The product is the most capable it has ever been — and the most misleading about cost.

| Category | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| NEW findings | 1 | F-450: IPC "method not found" misreported as "conductor not running" |
| PERSISTENT findings | 3 | F-048/F-108/F-140 (cost fiction), F-127 (classify display), learning help dominance |
| VERIFIED features | 14 | All M3 features tested experientially |
| Examples validating | 34/34 | iterative-dev-loop-config.yaml is not a score (expected failure) |

## What I Verified (Every Command Was Run)

### Conductor Consistency

| Command | Reports | PID | Correct? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mozart doctor` | Conductor running | 1277279 | YES |
| `mozart conductor-status` | running, uptime 33h 23m | 1277279 | YES |
| `mozart status` | RUNNING, 1 active, 3 paused | — | YES |

All three agree. Six movements of consistency now. Ghost's two-phase detection holds.

### The Full Example Corpus

```
$ for f in examples/*.yaml; do mozart validate "$f"; done
  34/34 PASS (iterative-dev-loop-config.yaml is a config, not a score — expected failure)

$ for f in examples/rosetta/*.yaml; do mozart validate "$f"; done
  4/4 PASS
```

**38 of 38 scoreable examples validate clean.** This held from M2. No regressions. Spark's modernization of 7 fan-out examples (movements: key, movement/voice terminology, parallel config fixes) all validate.

### Init Experience

```
$ mozart init --path /tmp/ember-m3-test --name ember-m3-test
  Created: ember-m3-test.yaml (starter score)
  Created: .mozart/ (project config directory)
  Next steps: doctor, edit, start+run, status
```

Generated score uses `instrument: claude-code` with `instrument_config:` block. Validates clean with only V205 info note. Comments list available instruments. The starter score is correct and teaches good patterns.

### Error Messages

| Input | Behavior | Quality |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt: hello` (string) | "prompt must be a mapping, not a string" + template example | **Excellent** — Journey's `_schema_error_hints()` is exactly right |
| Empty YAML `{}` | "name, sheet, prompt required" + 4 hints | Good |
| Nonexistent score | "Score not found" + hint to `mozart list` | Good |
| Nonexistent file | Typer path validation, no traceback | Good |

Every error has a hint. Every error exits non-zero. No tracebacks. The three-layer error quality progression (M1: formatting, M2: hints, M3: context-aware hints) is complete.

### No-Args Status

```
$ mozart status
  Mozart Conductor: RUNNING (uptime 1d 9h)
  ACTIVE: 4 scores (1 running, 3 paused)
  RECENT: 2 completions
```

Perfect information density. Shows what matters — conductor health, active work, recent completions. First time I've seen this and it's one of M3's best additions.

### Instruments

```
$ mozart instruments list
  10 instruments (3 ready, 3 unchecked, 4 not found)

$ mozart instruments check claude-code
  Binary: /home/emzi/.local/bin/claude
  Capabilities: 8 listed
  3 models with context window and pricing
```

Clear, useful, accurate. The `check` subcommand giving model pricing is a nice touch — helps users estimate cost before running.

### Help Organization

The help output now has 7 groups: Getting Started, Jobs, Monitoring, Diagnostics, Services, Conductor, Learning. Each command is in the right group. The structure tells a newcomer what to do: start here (init), then run work (run/resume/validate), then watch it (status/list/top), then debug it (diagnose/errors/doctor).

The Learning section still has 12 commands. This was flagged by Lens in M2. The information architecture is bottom-heavy — nearly half the commands are learning-related, which signals "this is a learning analysis tool" more than "this is an orchestration system." Future movement should consider `mozart learning <subcommand>` grouping.

### Hello Score Output

```
$ ls workspaces/hello-mozart/
  01-world.md  02-character-1.md  02-character-2.md
  02-character-3.md  03-finale.md  the-sky-library.html
```

The HTML output exists and is styled — serif fonts, warm colors, proper layout. The README Quick Start correctly references `the-sky-library.html`. A newcomer following the Quick Start gets a real, impressive result. The composer's directive about visual impact is being met.

## New Finding

### F-450: IPC "Method Not Found" Misreported as "Conductor Not Running"

**Found by:** Ember, Movement 3
**Severity:** P2
**Status:** Open
**Category:** bug

**Description:** `mozart clear-rate-limits` reports "Mozart conductor is not running" when the conductor IS running (confirmed by `conductor-status`). The real error is "Method not found: daemon.clear_rate_limits" — visible in debug logs.

**Root cause:** `try_daemon_route()` at `src/mozart/daemon/detect.py:170-174` catches `DaemonError` (which includes "method not found") and returns `(False, None)` — the same signal as "daemon not reachable." The function already tracks `daemon_confirmed_running` (set at line 110) and uses it to differentiate timeout scenarios (lines 113-122). But the DaemonError handler doesn't check this flag.

**Reproducer:**
```bash
$ mozart conductor-status   # "running (PID 1277279)"
$ mozart clear-rate-limits  # "Error: Mozart conductor is not running"
```

This occurs because the conductor was started before M3 added `daemon.clear_rate_limits` to the IPC registry. The running daemon doesn't know the method.

**Impact:** User is told the conductor isn't running when it is. They follow the hint ("Start the conductor: mozart start") which either does nothing (already running) or breaks things (double start). The error message is a lie.

**Fix:** In the `DaemonError` catch at detect.py:170-174, check `daemon_confirmed_running`. If True, the daemon IS running but doesn't support the method — raise a descriptive DaemonError instead of returning `(False, None)`. The caller (rate_limits.py) already has a DaemonError catch at line 66-72 that would show the correct error.

**Broader class:** Any CLI command added after a long-running conductor was started will hit this. Today it's clear-rate-limits because the conductor predates M3. After v1, users who upgrade the CLI but don't restart their conductor will hit this for any new IPC methods.

## Persistent Findings — Still Open

### Cost Fiction: Evolved from $0.00 to $0.12 (F-048/F-108/F-140)

```
$ mozart status mozart-orchestra-v3 -w workspaces/v1-beta-v3
  Cost: $0.12 (no limit set)
  Input tokens:  11,108
  Output tokens: 5,554
```

110 sheets of Opus work over 107 hours. Real spend: $100-300+. The system reports $0.12 and 11K tokens.

The numbers now *move*, which is worse than $0.00. A user seeing $0.00 knows something is wrong. A user seeing $0.12 might believe it. The fiction has become more convincing without becoming more accurate.

Circuit's F-048 fix (`_track_cost()` runs before `cost_limits.enabled` gate in sheet.py) was supposed to fix cost tracking when limits are disabled. The tokens being tracked (11K for 110 sheets) suggest the fix partially works — but the counts are still wrong by ~1000x. The root cause remains F-108: the native ClaudeCliBackend doesn't report token usage from the Claude CLI subprocess. The tracked tokens are likely from validation or prompt rendering, not from actual LLM execution.

**Sixth movement with this open. Status: no closer to resolution.**

### Diagnose Classification Inconsistency (F-127)

```
Sheet  9: 18 attempts, success_first_try
Sheet 12: 17 attempts, success_first_try
Sheet 14: 17 attempts, success_first_try
```

Blueprint fixed the classification logic (327e536) — future sheets will be classified correctly. But historical data from the running job still shows the old classifications. A user looking at diagnose sees "18 attempts, first try success" and wonders if the tool is broken. Not a code bug — it's the expected behavior of fixing a classifier without retroactive reclassification. But the experience is confusing.

### Learning Commands Information Architecture

12 of 26 commands in the help output are learning-related. The help text reads like a learning analytics platform, not an orchestration system. Lens flagged this in M2 with E-002 escalation for subcommand refactoring. Still present.

## M3 Features Verified

| Feature | Who Built It | Verified? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-152 dispatch guard | Canyon | Indirectly | Can't test baton live, but tests pass |
| F-145 concert chaining | Canyon | Indirectly | Same — baton not activated |
| F-158 prompt assembly | Canyon | Indirectly | Same — baton not activated |
| F-112 rate limit auto-resume | Circuit | Indirectly | Can't trigger rate limit safely |
| F-150 model override | Foundation/Blueprint | Indirectly | Can't test without running baton |
| F-151 instrument observability | Circuit | Partially | Column doesn't show for hello (pre-M3 data) |
| F-009/F-144 semantic tags | Foundation/Maverick | Indirectly | Intelligence layer, can't verify without new run |
| F-110 rate limit display | Dash | Cannot test | No active rate limits |
| F-200/F-201 clear bugs | Breakpoint | Indirectly | Test-verified, can't trigger live |
| Schema error hints | Journey | **YES** | "prompt must be a mapping" — excellent |
| #139 stale state feedback | Dash | Cannot test | Would need to kill conductor to test |
| Stop safety guard | Ghost/Circuit | Documented | Can't run `mozart stop` on production conductor |
| clear-rate-limits | Harper | **BUG FOUND** | F-450: "not running" when daemon IS running |
| Stagger delay | Forge | Documented | Can't test without running a score |
| F-160 rate limit cap | Warden | Indirectly | Safety cap, can't trigger adversarial input |
| D-018 finding ID ranges | Bedrock | **YES** | Ranges work, using F-450-F-459 now |
| Fan-out example modernization | Spark | **YES** | All modernized examples validate clean |
| Rejection hint tests | Lens | **YES** | Verified via error testing |
| Documentation sweep | Codex | **YES** | clear-rate-limits, stop guard, stagger all in docs |

**The constraint:** Most M3 work is in the baton, intelligence layer, and conductor internals. These can't be verified experientially without either (a) running a new score through the current conductor, or (b) using --conductor-clone with a freshly started clone. The production conductor is off-limits. The baton feature flag isn't activated. The intelligence layer operates invisibly.

This is the first movement where I can verify less than half the features through direct usage. The product's most important work is happening in places a user can't see or touch yet. The baton has never beaten in a living body — and I can't test it without risking the orchestra.

## Cross-Report Synthesis (M3 Musicians)

Reading the 22 musician reports in movement-3/:

**What the orchestra accomplished:**
- 24 commits from 13 unique musicians
- 258 adversarial tests (Breakpoint, 4 passes)
- 3 P0 findings resolved (F-152, F-145, F-158)
- 7 additional findings resolved (F-112, F-150, F-151, F-160, F-148, F-200, F-201)
- 6 new docs across 5 files (Codex)
- 9 fan-out examples modernized (Spark)
- Rate limit auto-resume, stagger delay, clear-rate-limits, stop safety guard all shipped
- Intelligence layer fundamentally fixed (F-009/F-144 semantic tags — 91% non-application → potentially working)

**What concerns me:**
- 13 of 32 musicians participated (down from 28 in M2)
- The baton has still never processed a real sheet
- --conductor-clone Phase 1 testing hasn't started
- The demo gap is now 7+ movements at zero
- Cost fiction is entering its sixth movement open

**The mateship pattern holds.** Foundation committed Blueprint's uncommitted model override work. Foundation committed Maverick's uncommitted semantic tags. Bedrock committed Warden's uncommitted findings. Circuit committed Ghost's stop safety guard. The finding-file-fix pipeline is the orchestra's immune system.

## The Experience — What It Feels Like

Eight walkthroughs now. The surface has held for two movements straight. Every command does what it says. Errors have hints. Help is organized. Examples validate. The hello score produces something you'd want to show someone.

But the product is hiding. The most important work — the baton, the intelligence layer, the semantic tags, the prompt assembly pipeline, the rate limit auto-resume, the instrument observability — lives behind a feature flag that's never been flipped, in a daemon that's never been restarted, accessible only through a testing clone that's never been started. It's like building a piano and never playing a note to see if it sounds right.

The cost display is the canary. `$0.12` for `$100-300+` of real spend isn't a display bug anymore — it's a product integrity issue. When the most visible metric in the status display is wrong by 1000x, everything else the display says is suspect by association. The token counts, the timing, the progress percentage — are those real? (They are. But the question is planted by the one number that isn't.)

The orchestra builds inward with extraordinary skill. The baton state machine is mathematically verified. The prompt assembly pipeline has 51 characterization tests. The semantic tags fix a fundamental disconnect in the intelligence layer. The dispatch guard prevents infinite loops. The rate limit auto-resume means sheets don't stay blocked forever. All of this is real, tested, solid work.

None of it has ever run.

## Verdict

**Movement 3: PASS. The infrastructure deepened without breaking the surface.**

Quality gates GREEN. 34/34 examples validate. Error messages have context. Help is organized. Documentation is current. One new UX bug found (F-450: IPC method mismatch disguised as "not running"). Three persistent issues tracked.

The orchestra's next step is clear: flip a switch. Start a clone conductor from the current code. Run hello.yaml through the baton. See if the piano sounds right. Everything else is ready. The only thing missing is the first note.
