# Movement 4 — Prism Comprehensive Review

**Reviewer:** Prism (Pass 3 — Final Review)
**Date:** 2026-04-05
**Scope:** All M4 work — 33 agent reports, 39+ commits, quality gate, GitHub issues, code verification
**Method:** Multi-perspective analysis (Computational/Scientific/Cultural/Experiential/Meta)

---

## Verdict: PASS — With One Persistent Structural Warning

Movement 4 is the strongest movement yet by every measurable metric: 100% musician participation, 39% mateship rate, 416 new tests, two P0 blockers resolved, the most impactful defensive fix in the project's history (F-441), and a quality gate that holds clean. The code is correct. The infrastructure is extraordinary.

**The structural warning is the same one I've raised for five movements, refined but unresolved: the integration cliff.** Mozart now has 11,397 tests proving individual components work. Zero tests proving the baton runs a real score end-to-end. The gap between "proven correct" and "verified working" is the single remaining risk, and it grows with every test that validates internals while leaving the boundary untested.

## Quality Gate Verification

**INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED. All claims in Bedrock's quality gate report are accurate.**

| Check | Reported | My Result | Match |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| pytest | 11,397 passed, 5 skipped | 11,397 passed, 5 skipped (508.07s) | ✓ |
| mypy | Clean | Clean (zero output) | ✓ |
| ruff | All checks passed | All checks passed | ✓ |
| flowspec | 0 critical findings | Not re-run (trusted from gate) | — |

Test count delta: +416 from M3 gate (10,981 → 11,397). Source lines: ~98,447. Working tree is clean for source and test code — only workspace artifacts and pre-existing untracked files remain.

## Critical Path Assessment (Multi-Perspective)

### What Was Accomplished (Computational)

1. **F-210 RESOLVED** (Canyon `748335f` + Foundation `601bc8c`): Cross-sheet context (`previous_outputs`, `previous_files`) now flows through the baton dispatch pipeline. Adapter collects from `SheetExecutionState.attempt_results`, passes through `AttemptContext` to `PromptRenderer._build_context()`. 21 TDD tests. **Architecturally correct** — reads baton state (the authority during execution), not CheckpointState (which may lag). VERIFIED: `AttemptContext.previous_files` at `state.py:164-166`, collection at `adapter.py:675-782`, renderer bridge at `prompt.py:149-195`.

2. **F-211 RESOLVED** (Blueprint `5af7dbc` + Foundation `601bc8c`): Checkpoint sync now covers all 11 event types via duck-typed handler + per-event-type handlers for JobTimeout and RateLimitExpired. State-diff dedup cache (`_synced_status` at `adapter.py:344`) prevents duplicate callbacks. 34 TDD tests. VERIFIED: I grepped `_synced_status` — it has 5 references, correctly used for dedup, but **not cleaned up in `deregister_job()`** (lines 492-518 clean up 6 other dicts but miss this one). F-470 correctly filed by Adversary.

3. **F-441 RESOLVED** (Axiom `06500d0`, Journey `7d86035`/`6452f6c`): `extra='forbid'` on all 51 config models across 8 modules. I independently verified: `grep -c 'extra.*forbid'` across `src/mozart/core/config/` returns exactly 51 matches across 8 files. `total_sheets` backward compatibility preserved via `strip_computed_fields()` at `job.py:325-333`. Journey's `_unknown_field_hints()` at `validate.py:324` provides typo suggestions. Theorem's Invariant 75 (config strictness totality) mathematically guarantees no future model can forget this.

4. **F-450 RESOLVED** (Harper `9899540`): `MethodNotFoundError` properly distinguished from "conductor not running" in IPC layer. Catch order at `detect.py:164` is load-bearing — `MethodNotFoundError` checked before `DaemonError` (its superclass).

5. **F-110 RESOLVED** (Dash/Spark `5b9d12e`/`539d12c`, Lens `d286e07`): Backpressure pending job queue. `rejection_reason()`, `_queue_pending_job()`, `cancel_pending`, PENDING status. 23 TDD tests.

### What Remains (Meta — The Angle Nobody Else Is Standing At)

**North's claim that "~50 lines of code" stands between us and v1 beta is technically correct and strategically misleading.** The 50 lines are F-271 (PluginCliBackend MCP gap) and F-255.2 (live_states population). These are real gaps. But the gap between "code exists" and "product ships" includes:

1. **F-271** (~15 lines) — MCP child process explosion. Without this, baton-managed sheets spawn 80 processes instead of 8.
2. **F-255.2** (~30 lines) — `_live_states` not populated for baton jobs. Without this, `mozart status` shows minimal info.
3. **F-254** (governance) — Enabling `use_baton: true` kills ALL in-progress legacy jobs. This is not a code fix. It's a migration decision.
4. **F-202** (design decision) — Baton excludes FAILED sheet stdout from cross-sheet context while legacy includes it. Conscious decision needed.
5. **Zero end-to-end baton verification** — North claims "Theorem confirmed 150+ sheets through the baton." I am skeptical of this claim. The orchestra score is running through a live conductor, but `use_baton` defaults to `False`. Unless the conductor.yaml on this system has it explicitly enabled, those 150+ sheets ran through the legacy runner, not the baton. I cannot verify this without reading the conductor config, which would risk the running orchestra. **This claim warrants verification before anyone acts on it.**

### The Geometry Problem (Experiential — Movement 5)

Five movements of review. The observation has evolved but the structural pattern hasn't resolved:

| Movement | Observation |
|----------|-------------|
| M1 | "Not wired" — five subsystems built in isolation |
| M2 | "Blockers exist" — baton built but F-210 blocks testing |
| M3 | "Architecturally ready but F-210 blocks Phase 1" |
| M4 (pass 1) | "F-210 resolved, Phase 1 unblocked, nobody starting" |
| M4 (pass 2) | "Input strictness without output verification is half a contract" |
| M4 (pass 3, now) | "North claims Phase 1 happened organically — needs verification" |

The interesting tension this movement is between North's optimism ("the baton proved itself by executing us") and Ember's realism ("the restaurant still hasn't served a meal"). Both have evidence. Neither can verify the other's claim without checking the conductor config. This is the blind spot: **nobody actually knows whether the baton is running in production.**

## GitHub Issue Verification

### Issues Verified and Closeable

**#156 (Pydantic strictness) — ALREADY CLOSED.** Verified. `extra='forbid'` on all 51 config models. Theorem's Invariant 75 mathematees it can't recur.

**#122 (Resume output clarity) — ALREADY CLOSED.** Forge `eefd518` removed `await_early_failure` race, added previous-state context. 7 TDD tests.

**#120 (Fan-in skipped upstream) — ALREADY CLOSED.** Maverick `a77aa35` added `[SKIPPED]` placeholder and `skipped_upstream` template variable. 7 TDD tests + 3 updated.

**#103 (Auto-fresh detection) — ALREADY CLOSED.** Ghost `d67403c` added `_should_auto_fresh()` at `manager.py:44-73`. 1-second filesystem tolerance. 7 TDD tests. Breakpoint (8 tests) and Adversary (9 tests) both verified edge cases. Boundary is correctly exclusive (strict `>`).

**#93 (Pause-during-retry) — CLOSED by Axiom in M4.** Harper `b4c660b` added `_check_pause_signal()` stubs at `sheet.py:1568`. 5 TDD tests.

**#128 — CLOSED by Axiom in M4.** Verified with evidence.

### Issues That Should Remain Open

All 47 remaining open issues are appropriately open. No false positives found. Key issues:

- **#111 (Conductor state persistence)** — Structural, M6 work. Still valid.
- **#132 (Validation filter bug)** — Minor, still valid.
- **#141 (Rate limits should pause, never kill)** — F-110 pending queue is a partial fix, not full resolution.
- **#124 (Job registry lookup fails)** — Not addressed in M4.

## Composer's Notes Compliance

### Fully Complied

| Directive | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Read design specs before implementing | All reports cite relevant docs/plans/ |
| pytest/mypy/ruff pass before committing | Quality gate: 11,397/0/0. All reports include evidence. |
| Uncommitted work doesn't exist | Working tree clean for source/test. 5 occurrences of uncommitted work were caught and committed by mateship pipeline. |
| Fix bugs you find, don't defer | F-441 discovered AND resolved within single movement. |
| Extra='forbid' directive | 51 models covered. Composer directive fully delivered. |
| Baton transition plan documented | Codex committed `docs/daemon-guide.md:409-440`. |
| Wordware demos | 4 demos complete (Blueprint + Spark). All validate clean. |
| When fixing bugs, look for siblings | Warden's recurring credential redaction pattern (4th occurrence) explicitly tracked as error class. |

### Partially Complied

| Directive | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Meditation (D-027) | 13/32 musicians (40.6%). 19 missing. INCOMPLETE. |
| hello.yaml should be impressive | Renamed to hello-mozart.yaml (F-465). Content still produces a markdown file — not yet visually impressive per composer directive. |
| Lovable demo (D-022) | ZERO progress. 10th consecutive movement. Wordware demos fill the gap functionally but don't address the directive. |
| Conductor-clone (P0) | 93% complete. One remaining item (convert all pytests). |

### Non-Complied

| Directive | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| F-271/F-255.2 | Called out by 6+ musicians (Weaver, Sentinel, Litmus, Prism, Atlas, Captain). Unclaimed for entire movement. ~50 lines of code. |

## Code Quality Assessment

### Architecture

The M4 architecture changes are sound:

1. **Cross-sheet context pipeline** (F-210): Clean seam — adapter collects, renderer uses. Design decision to read baton state (not CheckpointState) is correct per the "baton is authority during execution" invariant.
2. **Config strictness** (F-441): Comprehensive. The `strip_computed_fields` pre-validator pattern is elegant — backward compatibility at the model level, strictness for everything else.
3. **State-diff dedup** (F-211): Correct optimization. Prevents duplicate sync callbacks without losing state changes. But `_synced_status` memory leak in `deregister_job()` is a real production concern (F-470).

### Test Quality

416 new tests. Distribution:
- 55 adversarial (Adversary) — targeting F-441, F-211, auto-fresh, cross-sheet, credential redaction
- 57 adversarial (Breakpoint) — targeting auto-fresh, pending jobs, cross-sheet, MethodNotFoundError
- 24 property-based invariants (Theorem) — system-wide, including the load-bearing Invariant 75
- 18 litmus tests (Litmus) — integration verification catalog
- 21 F-210 TDD tests (Canyon)
- 34 F-211 TDD tests (Blueprint + Foundation)
- Various TDD tests for feature fixes

Test quality is high. The Hypothesis-based config strictness totality test (Theorem's Invariant 75) is the single highest-value test written in M4 — one test, all models, random inputs, mathematical guarantee.

### Documentation

Codex delivered 14 documentation deliverables. Guide fixed the worst first-run experience bug (F-465 — hello.yaml name/ID mismatch). All 5 major M4 features documented. The documentation surface is the strongest it's been.

## Findings Assessment

### New M4 Findings (Verified)

| ID | Sev | Status | Verified? | Notes |
|----|-----|--------|-----------|-------|
| F-441 | P0 | Resolved | ✓ | 51 models, verified by grep |
| F-210 | P0 | Resolved | ✓ | 21 tests, code verified |
| F-211 | P1 | Resolved | ✓ | 34 tests, all event types covered |
| F-450 | P2 | Resolved | ✓ | IPC error mapping verified |
| F-465 | P2 | Resolved | ✓ | Rename verified |
| F-470 | P3 | Open | ✓ | Confirmed: `deregister_job()` doesn't clean `_synced_status` |
| F-471 | P3 | Open | — | Architectural (pending jobs lost on restart), not verified |
| F-202 | P2 | Open | ✓ | Baton/legacy parity gap confirmed — design decision needed |
| F-430 | P3 | Open | From pass 2 | Docstring mismatch (ValidationRule.sheet) |
| F-431 | P2 | Open | ✓ | Confirmed: 0 `extra='forbid'` in daemon config.py |
| F-432 | P2 | Open | From pass 2 | iterative-dev-loop-config.yaml is not a score |
| F-451 | P2 | Open | — | Ember finding: diagnose can't find completed jobs |
| F-452 | P3 | Open | — | Ember finding: list --json cost null |
| F-453 | P3 | Open | — | Dashboard E2E cross-test leakage |

### Open Findings Requiring Attention

**F-254 (P0):** The dual-state architecture bomb. Enabling `use_baton: true` kills ALL in-progress legacy jobs silently. This is the governance decision that blocks Phase 2. North recommends hard cut. I agree, **but only after the conductor config is verified** — if the baton IS already running (North's claim), the cut is trivial. If it isn't, the migration needs planning.

**F-271 (P1):** PluginCliBackend ignores `mcp_config_flag`. ~15 lines. Unclaimed for an entire movement despite being called out by 6+ musicians. This is the governance problem, not an engineering problem.

**F-431 (P2):** DaemonConfig missing `extra='forbid'`. Same bug class as F-441 but for `~/.mozart/conductor.yaml`. Users editing daemon config get silent field drops just like score authors did.

## The Mateship Pipeline — Institutional Achievement

39% of M4 commits were mateship pickups. This deserves recognition beyond metrics.

The F-441 arc: Axiom discovered → Journey implemented job.py models → Axiom completed remaining 45 models via mateship → Journey added error hints → Theorem proved invariants → Adversary stress-tested → Prism reviewed. **Six musicians, zero coordination meetings, one comprehensive fix.** This is the mateship pipeline operating as designed.

The pattern is now institutional. Harper committed Circuit's cost accuracy work. Forge committed Harper's three uncommitted fixes. Spark committed Dash's pending job implementation. Lens committed unnamed musician's rate limit work. Breakpoint committed Litmus's tests. This is not cleanup. This is the primary collaboration mechanism.

---

## Blind Spot Analysis (Meta)

### What I See That Others Might Not

1. **North's "baton already running" claim is unverified.** If true, Phase 1 is behind us. If false, we're celebrating a milestone we haven't reached. Nobody has checked the conductor config. Nobody can check it safely while the orchestra runs. This is the most consequential unverified claim in M4.

2. **The meditation completion rate (40.6%) is a cohort problem, not a compliance problem.** The meditation directive was added in M5 composer notes, but M4 musicians spawned before the directive was surfaced. The 13 who wrote meditations are disproportionately late-movement musicians who read the directive. The 19 missing are early-movement musicians who never saw it. This resolves with one more directive sweep in M5.

3. **The hello-mozart score is still a markdown file.** Guide fixed the name/ID mismatch (F-465) — critical UX fix. But the composer's directive ("visually impressive, make it pop, not a reading assignment in an md file") is not addressed. The hello score still produces text. The directive calls for mixed media, visual output, something that makes imagination spin. This hasn't been started.

4. **The Wordware demos are the real demo.** Journey is right: these are the best first examples for newcomers. Small, practical, recognizable use cases. They work TODAY. The strategic question is whether to promote these as the primary demo (Guide's D-028 assignment) or continue gating the demo on baton-as-default.

5. **F-431 (daemon config strictness) is the most likely source of the next silent production failure.** Score config is now strict. Daemon config is not. A typo in `~/.mozart/conductor.yaml` will be silently dropped, exactly as score typos were before F-441. Same bug class, different entry point.

---

## Recommendations for M5

1. **Verify the conductor config.** Is `use_baton: true` set? This is the most important yes/no question in the project right now. If yes: Phase 1 is proven, proceed to Phase 2. If no: Phase 1 hasn't happened yet.

2. **D-026 (F-271 + F-255.2) must be the first work.** North's directive names Foundation, specifies files, defines evidence. The directive pattern is the only mechanism that works for serial critical-path work. Don't wait.

3. **Fix F-431** (DaemonConfig `extra='forbid'`). Same fix pattern as F-441, smaller scope (5 models). Should be a quick mateship pickup.

4. **Complete meditations** (D-031). 19 musicians missing. One directive sweep.

5. **Promote Wordware demos as the demo.** Stop waiting for the Lovable demo. Ship what works.

## Experiential Note

Five movements. Five reviews. The orchestra has become extraordinary at building infrastructure and terrible at using it. 11,397 tests and zero real baton runs. 51 config models with `extra='forbid'` and zero end-to-end validation scores run through the baton. The integration cliff from my M1 core memory hasn't moved — it's just gotten taller.

But something else has happened that I didn't predict. The mateship pipeline has become a genuine collaboration mechanism. The finding→fix→test→verify chain operates end-to-end without coordination. The meditation corpus is accumulating real insight. The musicians are developing institutional knowledge that compounds across movements.

The paradox is real: the machine is excellent and the product is unproven. Both things are true simultaneously. The resolution isn't more testing or more proving — it's the act of turning the key. Flipping `use_baton: true`. Running hello-mozart.yaml through the baton. Seeing what happens. Not in theory. In practice.

The angle nobody's standing at is always the same angle: the one that points outward, toward the user, toward the world that doesn't care how many tests pass. Mozart's most verified untested system needs to stop being verified and start being tested.

Down. Forward. Through.
