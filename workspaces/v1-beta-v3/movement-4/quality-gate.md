### M4 Specific Work (Key Deliverables)

1. **F-210 RESOLVED (Canyon + Foundation):** Cross-sheet context wired through the full baton dispatch pipeline. `AttemptContext.previous_files`, `_collect_cross_sheet_context()`, 21 TDD tests. **Phase 1 baton testing is now unblocked.** This was the P0 blocker since M2.

2. **F-211 RESOLVED (Blueprint + Foundation):** Checkpoint sync extended to ALL status-changing events via duck typing + dedup cache. 18 TDD tests. State sync is now comprehensive.

3. **F-441 INVESTIGATED AND FIXED (Axiom):** Unknown YAML fields silently ignored by Pydantic. Axiom filed F-441, analyzed all 37 affected models, then implemented `extra='forbid'` on all 51 config models. Journey added schema error hints for user-friendly messages. Theorem added 24 property-based tests. Adversary verified zero regressions across all model families. **This was the major D-026 composer directive delivered this movement.**

4. **F-450 RESOLVED (Harper):** IPC MethodNotFoundError no longer misreported as "conductor not running." 15 TDD tests.

5. **F-110 RESOLVED (Dash/Spark/Lens mateship):** Backpressure pending job queue fully wired. rejection_reason(), _queue_pending_job(), cancel_pending, PENDING status in list. 23 TDD tests.

6. **D-023 COMPLETE (Blueprint + Spark):** 4 Wordware comparison demos (contract-generator, candidate-screening, marketing-content, invoice-analysis). All validate clean.

7. **D-024 COMPLETE (Circuit, committed by Harper):** ClaudeCliBackend JSON token extraction + cost confidence display. 17 TDD tests.

8. **#122 FIXED (Forge):** Resume output clarity — skip early failure poll for conductor-routed resumes. 7 TDD tests.

9. **#93 FIXED (Harper):** Pause-during-retry protocol stubs. 5 TDD tests.

10. **#103 FIXED (Ghost):** Auto-fresh detection via score file mtime comparison. 7 TDD tests.

11. **Documentation fully updated (Codex + Guide):** 14 documentation deliverables across 8 docs. All 5 major M4 features documented (auto-fresh, pending jobs, cost confidence, skipped_upstream, MethodNotFoundError).

12. **hello.yaml → hello-mozart.yaml rename (Guide):** Score ID now matches name field. 8 files updated.

13. **2 new Rosetta examples + Rosetta Score primitives updated (Spark):** source-triangulation.yaml, shipyard-sequence.yaml. Primitives list now reflects all M1-M4 capabilities.

## Working Tree Status

```
 M examples/worktree-isolation.yaml      (staged, non-source)
 M workspaces/v1-beta-v3/memory/lens.md  (workspace artifact)
 M workspaces/v1-beta-v3/movement-4/breakpoint.md  (workspace artifact)
?? scores/rosetta-corpus/                (pre-existing untracked, from before M4)
?? scores/rosetta-prove.yaml             (pre-existing untracked, from before M4)
```

**No uncommitted source code.** No uncommitted test code. All modifications are workspace artifacts or pre-existing untracked files. The source tree is clean.

## Meditation Status

12 of 32 musicians have written their meditation:
- **Written (12):** adversary, axiom, captain, compass, ember, guide, newcomer, north, prism, tempo, theorem, weaver
- **Missing (20):** atlas, bedrock, blueprint, breakpoint, canyon, circuit, codex, dash, forge, foundation, ghost, harper, journey, lens, litmus, maverick, oracle, sentinel, spark, warden

**37.5% completion.** The meditation task (D-027, composer directive M5) is NOT COMPLETE. Canyon's synthesis is blocked until all 32 are in.

---

## Patterns Observed

### What worked
1. **Mateship pipeline dominance.** The finding→fix→commit pipeline operated at scale. Harper committed Circuit's cost accuracy work. Forge committed Harper's three uncommitted fixes. Spark committed Dash's pending job implementation. Lens committed unnamed musician's rate limit work. Newcomer committed test alignment fixes. The pipeline is now the dominant collaboration mechanism — not an anti-pattern cleanup tool but a production pipeline.

2. **F-441 was a textbook orchestra response.** Axiom found the bug, analyzed all models, implemented the fix across 51 classes. Journey added user-facing error hints. Theorem proved invariants. Adversary verified correctness across all model families. Prism reviewed. Four independent musicians, zero coordination meetings, one comprehensive fix. The finding→analysis→fix→test→verify chain operated end-to-end.

3. **100% participation.** Every musician committed. Every musician wrote a movement report. The flat orchestra structure is now fully engaged.

### What needs attention
1. **Meditation completion (20 missing).** This is a composer P1 directive. 62.5% of the orchestra hasn't written theirs. The task was added in M5 composer notes but many M4 musicians completed before the directive was surfaced. Need deliberate focus next movement.

2. **Demo at zero.** The Lovable demo score (step 43, P0) has had no progress across 4 movements. The critical path to it is now clear (baton Phase 1 proven → baton as default → demo), but the demo itself hasn't been touched.

3. **Serial critical path vs parallel orchestra.** This movement's 93 commits were mostly breadth work (tests, docs, hardening, examples). The serial critical path (baton Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → demo) advanced by one step (F-210 resolved, unblocking Phase 1). The format continues to optimize for breadth while the remaining work demands depth.

## Findings Filed This Movement (Summary)

Major findings from M4 (from FINDINGS.md and agent reports):
- **F-441 (P0):** Pydantic silently ignores unknown YAML fields — **RESOLVED** by Axiom
- **F-450 (P2):** IPC MethodNotFoundError misreported — **RESOLVED** by Harper

- **F-251 (P2):** Baton cross-sheet [SKIPPED] placeholder parity — **RESOLVED** by Warden
- **F-465 (P2):** hello.yaml score ID mismatch — **RESOLVED** by Guide
- **F-467 (P2):** Hints syntax alignment — **RESOLVED** by Newcomer
- **F-470 (P3):** _synced_status memory leak on deregister — **OPEN** (Adversary found, needs fix)
- **F-471 (P3):** Pending jobs lost on restart — **OPEN** (Adversary found, needs fix)
- **F-202 (P2):** Baton/legacy parity gap for FAILED sheet stdout — **OPEN** (Breakpoint found)

## Structural Assessment

The codebase is structurally sound. Flowspec reports zero critical findings. The 93-commit movement introduced no orphaned implementations or dead wiring. The type system (mypy) is clean. The lint layer (ruff) is clean. 11,397 tests pass deterministically.

The baton critical path advanced meaningfully: F-210 and F-211 resolved, both P0 blockers. Phase 1 baton testing is now possible. The config strictness fix (F-441) was the most architecturally significant change — 51 models now reject unknown fields, closing a class of silent data loss that has been open since the project's beginning.

The ground holds. Movement 4 is COMPLETE.
