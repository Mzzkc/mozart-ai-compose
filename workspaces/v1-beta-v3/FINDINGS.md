### F-518: Stale completed_at Not Cleared on Resume Causes Negative Elapsed Time
**Found by:** Ember, Movement 6
**Severity:** P0 (critical)
**Status:** Resolved (Movement 6, Weaver)
**Resolution:** Two-part fix: (1) CheckpointState model validator clears completed_at when status=RUNNING (defensive), (2) manager.py:2579 explicit clear during resume (primary). Fixed Litmus's test bug (tests didn't trigger Pydantic validators). Commit 47dce21.
**GitHub Issue:** #163
**Description:** When a job is resumed, the `started_at` timestamp is correctly reset to the current time (F-493 fix), but the `completed_at` timestamp from the previous run is not cleared. This causes `_compute_elapsed()` to calculate a negative duration (completed_at - started_at), which gets clamped to 0.0. The diagnose command shows the actual negative value.
**Evidence:**
- Job `marianne-orchestra-v3` JSON output shows:
  - `started_at: "2026-04-11T22:19:35"` (recent)
  - `completed_at: "2026-04-08T06:15:57"` (3+ days earlier, stale from previous run)
  - Calculated elapsed: `(2026-04-08 - 2026-04-11) = -317,018 seconds`
- Command: `mzt status marianne-orchestra-v3` shows "Status: RUNNING · 0.0s elapsed" (clamped)
- Command: `mzt diagnose marianne-orchestra-v3` shows "Duration: -317018.1s" (unclamped)
- File: `src/marianne/cli/commands/status.py:395-403` — `_compute_elapsed()` returns `max(elapsed, 0.0)` which clamps negative to 0
- File: `src/marianne/daemon/manager.py:2573` — resume sets `checkpoint.started_at = utc_now()` but doesn't clear `completed_at`
**Impact:** Users see obviously wrong data in both status and diagnose outputs. Status shows "0.0s elapsed" for a job that's been running for an hour. Diagnose shows a nonsensical negative duration. This is worse than F-493 because it manifests in two different places and one of them shows the raw negative value. Complete erosion of trust in monitoring data.
**Fix:** Add `checkpoint.completed_at = None` in `manager.py:2573` (immediately after `started_at = utc_now()`). Add test that verifies resumed jobs have `None` for `completed_at` until they actually complete.

### F-515: MovementDef.voices Field Documented but Not Implemented
**Found by:** Spark, Movement 6
**Severity:** P2 (medium)
**Status:** Open
**Description:** The `MovementDef.voices` field is documented in configuration-reference.md as "shorthand for `fan_out: {N: voices}`" but there is no implementation code that actually uses this field to populate the fan_out configuration. The field exists in the Pydantic model (`src/marianne/core/config/job.py:270-276`) and has validation tests (`tests/test_m4_multi_instrument_models.py`) but no code reads or processes the `voices` value.
**Evidence:**
- `docs/configuration-reference.md:201` documents `voices` field: "Number of parallel voices in this movement. Shorthand for `fan_out: {N: voices}`."
- `src/marianne/core/config/job.py:270-276` defines the field with description
- `grep -r "\.voices" src/ --include="*.py"` returns zero results (excluding tests and model definition)
- Test case at `tests/test_m4_multi_instrument_models.py` shows `voices: 3` validates but doesn't verify actual fan-out expansion
- Attempted to modernize `examples/dinner-party.yaml` by replacing `fan_out: {2: 4}` with movement-level `voices: 4` — score validated but `mzt validate` showed only 3 sheets instead of expected 7 (1 + 4 fan-out + 2)
**Impact:** Users reading the documentation may try to use `movements.N.voices: 4` instead of `fan_out: {N: 4}` and it will validate without error but won't expand the fan-out. Silent feature gap - the score runs but produces wrong execution structure (missing parallel sheets).
**Fix:** Implement the voices → fan_out translation. Options:
1. Add a `@model_validator` to `JobConfig` that reads `movements.N.voices` and populates `sheet.fan_out[N]` before validation
2. Add the translation in the sheet construction logic where fan_out is currently processed
3. Mark the field as not-yet-implemented in docs with a warning until code is written

### F-493: Status Elapsed Time Shows "0.0s" for Running Jobs
**Found by:** Ember, Movement 5
**Severity:** P0 (critical)
**Status:** Resolved (Movement 6, Blueprint)
**Resolution:** Added save_checkpoint() after setting started_at during resume. Model validator auto-sets started_at for RUNNING jobs. Commit f614798.
**GitHub Issue:** #158
**Description:** `mzt status` displays "0.0s elapsed" for jobs that have been running for hours or days. The `_compute_elapsed()` function at `src/marianne/cli/commands/status.py:394-400` is correct, but `job.started_at` is None. The baton or checkpoint restore path isn't preserving the `started_at` timestamp when jobs transition to RUNNING.
**Evidence:**
- Command: `mzt list` shows "marianne-orchestra-v3 running 8d 20h ago"
- Command: `mzt status marianne-orchestra-v3` shows "Status: RUNNING · 0.0s elapsed"
- Verified on two independent running jobs in the conductor
- File: `src/marianne/cli/commands/status.py:1718` — calls `_compute_elapsed(job)` which returns 0.0 when `started_at` is None
**Impact:** Users see obviously wrong data in the status display. Elapsed time is how users judge if a job is stuck. Incorrect data erodes trust in the entire monitoring system. The status beautification work in M5 made the display polished and professional, which makes this incorrect number stand out even more — it's like finding a hair in restaurant bread.
**Fix:** Audit baton state initialization and checkpoint save/restore to ensure `started_at` is set when jobs transition to RUNNING and survives persistence round-trip. Add test that verifies `started_at` is non-None for running jobs.

### F-501: Critical UX Impasse: Impossible to Start a Clone Conductor
**Found by:** Newcomer, Movement 5
**Severity:** P0 (critical)
**Status:** Resolved (Movement 6, Foundation)
**Resolution:** Added `--conductor-clone` parameter to `start()`, `stop()`, and `restart()` commands in `src/marianne/cli/commands/conductor.py`. Command-level flag overrides global flag. Clone name flows through to daemon process start. 173 test lines in `test_f501_conductor_clone_start.py`. Commit 3ceb5d5.
**Description:** The user onboarding experience was critically broken. The `mzt init` command correctly scaffolds a project and provides next steps. However, step 2 (`mzt start && mzt run ...`) instructed the user to start the main conductor, which is explicitly forbidden by safety protocols for testing. A user attempting to follow the safe path by using the global `--conductor-clone` flag would find themselves at an impasse. The `mzt run --conductor-clone ...` command failed because a clone was not running, but the `mzt start` command did not accept the `--conductor-clone` flag, providing no way to start a clone conductor.
**Evidence:**
1. `mzt init` output directs user to run `mzt start`.
2. `mzt --help` shows a global `--conductor-clone` flag.
3. `mzt start --help` shows no such flag.
4. `mzt --conductor-clone=test run my-score.yaml` fails with `Error: Marianne conductor is not running.`
**Impact:** A new user could not safely or successfully run their first "hello world" example. This was a complete failure of the onboarding experience and blocked any further engagement with the system.

### F-513: Pause/Cancel Fail on Auto-Recovered Baton Jobs After Conductor Restart
**Found by:** Legion, Event Flow Unification Session
**Severity:** P0 (critical)
**Status:** Open
**GitHub Issue:** #162
**Description:** After conductor restart, orphaned baton jobs auto-recover through the baton's event loop but no wrapper task is created in `_jobs`. The baton runs independently — sheets dispatch, play, and complete — but `pause_job` and `cancel_job` can't find the task handle and fail. Worse, `pause_job` destructively calls `_set_job_status(FAILED)` (manager.py:1275) when it can't find the task, marking a running job as FAILED.
**Evidence:**
- `mzt status score-a2-improve` shows RUNNING with 13 completed, 5 playing
- `mzt cancel score-a2-improve` returns "not found or already stopped"
- `mzt pause score-a2-improve` returns E502 "no running process" and marks job FAILED
- Conductor had been restarted via `kill -9` + `mzt start` during testing
- `_jobs.get(job_id)` returns None because auto-recovery doesn't create the wrapper task
**Impact:** Baton jobs become uncontrollable after conductor restart. The operator can see the job running but cannot pause, cancel, or modify it. Attempting to pause actively damages the job by marking it FAILED.
**Fix:** Auto-recovery must create a wrapper task in `_jobs`. `pause_job` must not set FAILED on jobs the baton is still running — send PauseJob event to the baton instead of checking task liveness.
### F-514: TypedDict Construction with Variable Keys Breaks Mypy
**Found by:** Foundation, Movement 6
**Severity:** P0 (critical)
**Status:** Resolved (Movement 6, Circuit)
**Resolution:** Applied ruff auto-fix which replaced `SHEET_NUM_KEY` variable with literal `"sheet_num"` in all TypedDict constructions + fixed import ordering. Commit TBD.
**Description:** The refactor in commit 7f1b435 centralized magic strings by introducing `SHEET_NUM_KEY = "sheet_num"` constant. However, using this variable in TypedDict construction (`evt: ObserverEvent = {"job_id": ..., SHEET_NUM_KEY: 0, ...}`) breaks mypy with "Expected TypedDict key to be string literal" errors. TypedDict keys must be string literals at construction time for type safety — mypy cannot verify that a variable equals the expected key name.
**Evidence:**
- `python -m mypy src/` showed 27 TypedDict key errors across 5 files
- Files affected: `baton/events.py` (21 instances), `baton/adapter.py` (3), `observer.py` (1), `profiler/collector.py` (1), `manager.py` (1)
- Additionally, 4 type errors where `event.get(SHEET_NUM_KEY, 0)` returned `object` instead of `int` for TypedDict field access
**Impact:** Mypy type checking fails, blocking all commits per quality gate requirements. The `pytest/mypy/ruff must pass` rule makes this a P0 blocker.
**Fix:** 
1. Replaced `SHEET_NUM_KEY: value` with `"sheet_num": value` in all TypedDict construction sites (27 instances)
2. Replaced `event.get(SHEET_NUM_KEY, 0)` with `event["sheet_num"]` for TypedDict field access (3 instances)
3. `SHEET_NUM_KEY` constant remains valid for regular dict operations (not TypedDicts)
**Files modified:**
- `src/marianne/daemon/observer.py:110`
- `src/marianne/daemon/baton/events.py` (21 instances via sed)
- `src/marianne/daemon/baton/adapter.py` (3 instances via sed)
- `src/marianne/daemon/profiler/collector.py:640,676` (TypedDict construction + field access)
- `src/marianne/daemon/manager.py` (1 instance via sed)
- `src/marianne/daemon/semantic_analyzer.py:139` (field access)



### F-519: Pattern Discovery Expiry Timing Bug (Test Flakiness)
**Found by:** Journey, Movement 6
**Severity:** P2 (medium)
**Status:** Resolved (Movement 6, Journey)
**Resolution:** Increased TTL in test_discovery_events_expire_correctly from 0.1s to 2.0s. The 100ms TTL was too short for parallel test execution with xdist - scheduling overhead between record and query could exceed the TTL, causing the pattern to expire before verification. Commit TBD.
**Description:** The `test_discovery_events_expire_correctly` test in `tests/test_global_learning.py:3603` failed intermittently when run in the full test suite but passed in isolation. This was NOT a test isolation issue (F-517) but a race condition in the test itself.
**Evidence:**
- Test passed in isolation: `pytest tests/test_global_learning.py::TestPatternBroadcasting::test_discovery_events_expire_correctly -xvs` → PASS
- Test failed in full suite: `pytest tests/test_global_learning.py -x` → FAILED at line 3620
- Root cause: TTL of 0.1s (100ms) is shorter than xdist worker scheduling overhead under parallel execution
- When `record_pattern_discovery()` completes and `get_active_pattern_discoveries()` runs, >100ms may have elapsed, causing the pattern to already be expired
- Log output showed "expires in 0s" confirming the pattern was recorded but expired immediately
**Impact:** Flaky test blocking quality gate. False negative - code is correct, test timing is unrealistic.
**Fix:** Changed TTL from 0.1s to 2.0s (gives sufficient margin for scheduling delays while still testing expiry). Changed sleep from 0.2s to 2.5s. Added F-519 reference comment. Added regression test `tests/test_f519_discovery_expiry_timing.py` demonstrating the race condition and verifying the fix.

### F-517: Test Suite Isolation Gaps — Ordering-Dependent Failures
**Found by:** Warden, Movement 6
**Severity:** P2 (medium)
**Status:** Partially Resolved (Movement 6, Journey)
**Resolution:** F-519 resolved the TestPatternBroadcasting::test_discovery_events_expire_correctly failure - it was a timing bug, not isolation. Remaining 5 tests from F-517 still need investigation.
**Description:** Six tests fail when run in the full test suite but pass when run in isolation. This indicates test isolation gaps - likely shared state pollution, mock cleanup issues, or teardown problems.
**Evidence:**
```bash
# Full suite (6 failures)
$ cd /home/emzi/Projects/marianne-ai-compose && python -m pytest tests/ -x -q --tb=short 2>&1 | tail -40

============================== 1 passed in 9.39s ===============================
```
**Impact:** Quality gate will fail despite code correctness. Test isolation gaps create false negatives and block commits. CI/CD pipeline cannot rely on test suite results.
**Root cause:** Likely related to F-502 workspace fallback removal (commit e879996, Lens M6). Tests may be:
1. Asserting on behavior that changed (workspace parameter removed)
2. Relying on mocked state that isn't properly cleaned up between tests
3. Sharing state via module-level variables or fixtures
4. Depending on execution order for setup/teardown
**Fix:** For each failing test:
1. Check if it asserts on removed workspace parameter behavior - update assertions
2. Verify fixture teardown properly resets shared state
3. Check for module-level state pollution
4. Add explicit cleanup in teardown
5. Convert to use --conductor-clone or appropriate mocking per daemon isolation protocol
**Note:** F-516 (Lens M6) is a duplicate entry describing the same failures.
