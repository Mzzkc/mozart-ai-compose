"""User journey tests: what real people see when they make score YAML mistakes.

These aren't unit tests for extra='forbid'. They're stories about real users
who make real mistakes and need real guidance — not generic "check your score"
messages.

Journey's principle: the bugs that make users quietly abandon your product
aren't crashes — they're confusion. These tests prove Mozart doesn't confuse.
