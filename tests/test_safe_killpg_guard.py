"""Regression tests for F-490: _safe_killpg guard in claude_cli backend.

F-490 root cause: ``os.killpg(os.getpgid(process.pid), signal.SIGKILL)`` in
claude_cli.py had no validation. If ``process.pid == 1`` (mock, stub, or
reaped-and-recycled PID), then ``os.getpgid(1) == 1``, and
``os.killpg(1, SIGKILL)`` compiles kernel-side to ``kill(-1, SIGKILL)`` —
"send SIGKILL to every process UID 1000 can signal except init." That kills
``systemd --user``, every bash shell in every WSL terminal, and any pytest
running in the same session. Exact signature of the user-reported
"exit code 00000009" WSL2 crashes.

These tests lock in the guard behavior. They deliberately do NOT run the
real ``os.killpg`` syscall for the unsafe cases — if the guard ever
regresses, a test run alone would kill the user's session.
