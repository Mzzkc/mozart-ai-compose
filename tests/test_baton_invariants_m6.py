"""Property-based invariant tests for Movement 6 features.

This module contains hypothesis-based property tests proving mathematical
invariants for M6 features and bug fixes.

Invariant families:
- 99-103: F-518 timestamp invariants (CheckpointState, SheetState status transitions)
- 104-107: Test isolation properties (daemon snapshot, conductor state)

Each invariant is numbered sequentially continuing from M5 (ended at 98).
These tests don't prove features work - they prove properties hold under
arbitrary inputs that the implementation claims to handle.
