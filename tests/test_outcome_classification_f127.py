"""Tests for F-127: _classify_success_outcome uses cumulative attempt_count.

After a conductor restart + resume, session-local normal_attempts resets to 0
while the persisted attempt_count reflects the true cumulative count. The outcome
classification must use the persisted count to avoid labeling a sheet with 18
attempts as "success_first_try".

TDD: Tests written first, implementation follows.
