"""Pattern lifecycle and promotion automation for GlobalLearningStore.

Provides automated pattern lifecycle transitions based on effectiveness metrics:
- promote_ready_patterns: Auto-promote patterns from PENDING to ACTIVE/QUARANTINED
- update_quarantine_status: Manual status updates

Lifecycle transitions:
- PENDING → ACTIVE: occurrences >= 3 AND effectiveness > 0.60
- PENDING → QUARANTINED: occurrences >= 3 AND effectiveness < 0.35
- ACTIVE → QUARANTINED: effectiveness drops below 0.30 after validation
- QUARANTINED → VALIDATED: Manual review and approval

Evolution v25 Candidate 2: This module implements the missing feedback loop
that allows patterns to mature beyond baseline effectiveness through
application → measurement → promotion.
