"""Instrument availability checks.

Checks whether a named instrument is available for execution.
Used by:
- ``mozart doctor`` — instrument health checks
- ``mozart validate`` — warn on unavailable instruments
- Baton dispatch path — pre-flight before execution

The check is simple:
1. Is the instrument registered in the registry?
2. If it's a CLI instrument, is the binary on PATH?
3. If it's a CLI instrument, does it have a command configured?

Non-CLI instruments (http, native) are assumed available if registered.
