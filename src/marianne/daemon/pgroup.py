"""Process group management for orphan prevention.

Addresses issue #38: cascading crashes from orphaned MCP server processes.
When the daemon is the process group leader, all child processes (backends,
validators, MCP servers) belong to the same pgid, enabling clean group-wide
shutdown via os.killpg().

Lifecycle:
    1. setup() — create new process group (daemon becomes leader)
    2. cleanup_orphans() — scan daemon's child tree for leaked processes
    3. reap_orphaned_backends() — system-wide scan for leaked backend children
    4. kill_all_children() — shutdown: signal entire group
    5. atexit handler — last-resort cleanup if shutdown is interrupted

The distinction between cleanup_orphans() and reap_orphaned_backends():
    cleanup_orphans() walks the daemon's own child tree via psutil.
    This misses processes that were reparented to init (PID 1) after
    their parent (e.g. Claude CLI) exited — which is exactly how
    MCP/LSP server leaks happen.  reap_orphaned_backends() scans
    ALL processes owned by the current user for known orphan patterns.
