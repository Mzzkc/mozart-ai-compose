"""Technique resolution for the baton dispatch pipeline.

Resolves which techniques are active for a given sheet phase, generates
technique manifests, and discovers technique skill documents for prompt
injection. This module bridges the technique declarations in JobConfig
(``TechniqueConfig``) to the prompt assembly pipeline in the baton adapter.

Skill-kind techniques are shorthand injections: declaring a technique by
name causes its document to be discovered from known locations and injected
into the musician's prompt as a skill-category item. This is the runtime
equivalent of the compiler's TechniqueWirer.

Search order for technique documents:
    1. ``config.path`` — explicit path in the technique's config
    2. ``~/.marianne/techniques/{name}.md`` — user-level techniques
    3. ``.marianne/techniques/{name}.md`` — project-level techniques
    4. ``~/.marianne/techniques/{name}/SKILL.md`` — subdirectory form

Usage::

    from marianne.daemon.baton.techniques import resolve_techniques_for_sheet

    resolved = resolve_techniques_for_sheet(config.techniques, "work")
    # resolved.manifest -> markdown text listing available techniques
    # resolved.skill_docs -> dict of technique name to document content
    # resolved.mcp_servers -> dict of MCP server names for config file generation
