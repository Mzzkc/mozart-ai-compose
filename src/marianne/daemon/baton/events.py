"""BatonEvent types — the vocabulary of the conductor's execution heart.

Every event the baton can receive is defined here as a frozen dataclass.
Events are the baton's sole input mechanism — it sleeps until an event
arrives, processes it, checks for dispatchable sheets, and sleeps again.

Events come from five sources:

- **Musicians** — sheet execution results (SheetAttemptResult, SheetSkipped)
- **Timer wheel** — scheduled future events (RetryDue, RateLimitExpired,
  StaleCheck, CronTick, JobTimeout, EscalationTimeout, PacingComplete)
- **External commands** — CLI/IPC/dashboard (PauseJob, ResumeJob, CancelJob,
  ConfigReloaded, EscalationResolved, ShutdownRequested)
- **Observer** — runtime monitoring (ProcessExited, ResourceAnomaly)
- **Internal** — dispatch coordination (DispatchRetry)

Design decisions:

- All events are frozen dataclasses — immutable after creation, safe to
  pass between asyncio tasks without copying.
- BatonEvent is the union type used for inbox typing.
- Events carry only the data needed for the baton to make a decision.
  They do not carry the full execution output (that's in CheckpointState).
- Events are compatible with the existing ObserverEvent TypedDict format
  via the ``to_observer_event()`` method for EventBus integration.

See: ``docs/plans/2026-03-26-baton-design.md`` for the full architecture.
