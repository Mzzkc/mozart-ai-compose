"""Timer wheel — all timing in the baton flows through here.

The timer wheel is a priority queue of future events. A background drain
task sleeps until the next timer fires, puts the event into the baton's
inbox, and repeats. Components never call ``asyncio.sleep()`` for scheduling
purposes — they schedule a timer instead.

Eight timing responsibilities converge here:
- Retry backoff delays
- Rate limit recovery waits
- Circuit breaker recovery timers
- Stale detection idle timeouts
- Inter-sheet pacing delays
- Concert cooldown between chained jobs
- Job wall-clock timeouts
- Cron ticks

Design:
- Priority queue via ``heapq`` — O(log n) schedule/fire.
- Cancelled timers are lazily skipped on fire (tombstone pattern),
  not eagerly removed — O(1) cancel.
- The drain task is woken by ``asyncio.Event`` when timers change,
  so adding an earlier timer doesn't wait for the previous sleep.
- All public methods are synchronous (no await needed to schedule).
  Only ``run()`` and ``shutdown()`` are async.

See: ``docs/plans/2026-03-26-baton-design.md`` — Timer Wheel section.
