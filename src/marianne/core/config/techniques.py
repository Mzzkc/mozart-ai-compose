"""Technique system configuration models.

Techniques are composable components attached to agent entities — an ECS
pattern for AI agents. Each technique is independently reusable across
projects, agents, and scores.

Three kinds:
- skill: Text-based methodology (memory protocol, mateship, coordination)
- mcp: MCP server tools accessible via shared pool (github, filesystem)
- protocol: Communication protocols (A2A)

Each technique declares which phases of the agent cycle it's available in,
allowing the compiler to inject technique manifests per-phase.
