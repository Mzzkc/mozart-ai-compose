"""Exception hierarchy for the Mozart daemon.

All daemon-specific exceptions inherit from DaemonError, enabling callers
to catch broad (DaemonError) or narrow (e.g., ResourceExhaustedError).
Follows the same flat hierarchy pattern as other Mozart modules
(WorktreeError, ParallelExecutionError, etc.).
