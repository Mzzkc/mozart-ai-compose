"""Conductor clone support — isolated conductor instances for safe testing.

When --conductor-clone is passed to any Mozart CLI command, all daemon
interactions are routed to a clone conductor instead of the production
one. The clone has its own socket, PID file, state DB, and log file.

This enables safe testing of Mozart CLI commands and daemon features
without risking the production conductor. The production conductor
continues running undisturbed.

Usage:
    mozart start --conductor-clone              # Start default clone
    mozart start --conductor-clone=staging      # Start named clone
    mozart run score.yaml --conductor-clone     # Submit to default clone
    mozart status --conductor-clone=staging     # Query named clone

Architecture:
    - A module-level _clone_name stores the active clone (set by CLI callback)
    - _resolve_socket_path() in detect.py checks get_clone_name() before
      falling back to SocketConfig defaults
    - resolve_clone_paths() computes all isolated paths from a clone name
    - build_clone_config() produces a DaemonConfig with clone-specific paths
