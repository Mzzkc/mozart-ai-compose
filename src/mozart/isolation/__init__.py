"""Isolation module for parallel job execution.

This module provides worktree-based isolation for Mozart jobs, enabling
multiple jobs to execute in parallel without interfering with each other's
file modifications.

Key components:
- GitWorktreeManager: Manages git worktree lifecycle
- WorktreeInfo: Information about a created worktree
- WorktreeResult: Result of worktree operations
- Exception classes for error handling
