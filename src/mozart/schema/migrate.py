"""Unified migration runner for all Mozart SQLite databases.

Applies numbered migrations sequentially using PRAGMA user_version
for version tracking. Each migration is either a SQL string (split
on semicolons) or an async callable for complex data transforms.

Design decisions:
- Uses individual execute() calls, NOT executescript() (which
  implicitly commits and breaks transactional safety).
- Each migration runs in its own transaction. On failure, that
  migration is rolled back and no further migrations are attempted.
- Forward-compatible: a database from a newer Mozart version
  produces a warning, not an error.
