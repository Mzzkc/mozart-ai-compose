"""Pattern-related mixin for GlobalLearningStore.

This module provides the PatternMixin class that handles all pattern-related
operations including:
- Recording and updating patterns
- Pattern application tracking
- Effectiveness and priority calculations
- Quarantine lifecycle management
- Trust scoring
- Success factor analysis (metacognitive reflection)
- Pattern discovery broadcasting

Extracted from global_store.py as part of the modularization effort.

Architecture:
    PatternMixin is now composed from focused sub-mixins, each handling a
    specific domain of pattern functionality:

    - PatternQueryMixin: Core query operations (get_patterns, get_pattern_by_id, etc.)
    - PatternCrudMixin: Create/update operations and effectiveness calculations
    - PatternQuarantineMixin: Quarantine lifecycle (quarantine, validate, retire)
    - PatternTrustMixin: Trust scoring and auto-apply eligibility
    - PatternSuccessFactorsMixin: Metacognitive reflection (WHY analysis)
    - PatternBroadcastMixin: Real-time pattern discovery broadcasting

    This decomposition improves maintainability while preserving the original
    public API through composition.
