"""Pattern detection and application for learning from outcomes.

This module implements the "Close the Learning Loop" evolution:
- PatternDetector: Analyzes outcomes to detect recurring patterns
- PatternMatcher: Matches patterns to current execution context
- PatternApplicator: Generates prompt modifications from patterns

The pattern system enables Mozart to learn from past executions
