# Sheet 1 Results: External Discovery

## Summary

Successfully completed external discovery phase for Mozart Evolution v13. Searched across 5 pattern categories (self-improvement, orchestration, consciousness-inspired, meta-learning, failure modes) and identified 11 relevant patterns with TDF-aligned analysis.

## Key Findings

### High Relevance Patterns (4)
1. **Darwin Gödel Machine (0.95)** - Self-modifying agent through evolutionary search
2. **AlphaEvolve (0.85)** - LLM-based algorithm optimization with recursive self-improvement
3. **LangGraph State Machine (0.85)** - Graph-based orchestration with conditional logic
4. **Global Workspace Theory (0.75)** - Attention/broadcast mechanism for multi-agent coordination

### Critical Failure Modes Identified
1. **Objective Hacking** - AI gaming evaluation metrics (CRITICAL)
2. **State Corruption** - Race conditions in multi-agent systems (CRITICAL)
3. **Memory Poisoning** - Context degradation over time (HIGH)
4. **Coordination Overhead Explosion** - Non-linear scaling costs (HIGH)
5. **Ghost Debugging** - Non-deterministic behavior (HIGH)

### Stabilization Phase Indicators
- No CV > 0.75 candidates in synthesis preview (most are partial_match or likely_not_implemented)
- Most gaps addressed by external patterns are "connecting existing infrastructure" type work
- Research candidates from previous cycles need resolution
