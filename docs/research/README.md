# Research Documents

Internal research and analysis documents. These are not user-facing
documentation — they record investigations, strategies, and meta-analyses
that informed Mozart's development.

- [Token Compression Strategies](TOKEN-COMPRESSION-STRATEGIES.md) — Research into reducing token costs (not yet implemented)
- [Opus Convergence Analysis](OPUS-CONVERGENCE-ANALYSIS.md) — Meta-analysis comparing Mozart and RLF evolution patterns
